       "'None\\nNone\\nNone\\nWhy did you become an aid worker?\\nI was backpacking through Asia, and I met Karen refugee children from Myanmar in a village in northern Thailand. I was giving them sweets and I was thinking ‘I hope, one day, I can come back with something better.’ That’s when I knew I wanted to work in this field.\\nThe Karen were the first displaced indigenous people I met. But since joining UNHCR in 1993, I have worked with other indigenous people in Guatemala, Panama, Colombia, Costa Rica and the Philippines.\\nWorking with them has become my priority and favourite area of work, because they are particularly vulnerable, and they are disproportionately affected by conflict. You have no doubt that they need protection.\\nWhat is the most rewarding/challenging thing about your job?\\nBeing the representative in Libya is the most challenging job I’ve ever had. Our access to Libya is very, very limited. Because of security restrictions we can only send one person at a time from our base in Tunis to get into Libya. Then there is all the paraphernalia to move around. You need two armed vehicles, you need two armed close protection from diplomatic police, which is very paralyzing. So this is one huge challenge which implies remote management of our national team there.\\nThere is more than one government. The one we are working with is in Tripoli, then other authorities around the country. We don’t have a memorandum of understanding, but our presence is tolerated. If I could change one thing, it would be being able to work from there.\\nMore than six years of violent upheaval in Libya began with the uprising that removed ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. We work with half a million people displaced within the country by conflict. These includes 200,000 displaced and 300,000 who were displaced but have recently returned, but are still in a fragile situation.\\nThen we work with refugees in the mixed migration movement, and there, also it is very complicated, because the authorities don’t recognize these people are refugees, and they don’t recognize our role. So now we have decided to evacuate thousands of refugees from Libya, because the situation is too dangerous for them.\\nWhile it is a challenge, we are making progress. So far this year we have had 950 people released from these horrible detention centres. Among them was an eight year old boy. I wrote a letter recently for another 2,280 who will be released, so to have these people taken out of detention will be pure protection work at its best.\\nAmong the cases that stand out is that of some 30 women who were enslaved by extremists in Sirte. When the city was liberated, they were detained by Libyan authorities on the basis that they were the partners of extremists. So we had them released, then we had them resettled to a safe country.\\nWhat was the best day that you had at work?\\nWhen I was in Colombia I carried out 250 missions to the deep field by horse, on foot, by small boat, going to communities in the remote jungle.\\nOne time I remember we went to the Chocó region – on the Pacific coast bordering Panama. We had to take a boat for two days, across the ocean and then up a river, to where the Emberá indigenous people were confined by drug traffickers.\\nWhen we reached the village, everyone ran away, because, at the time, the only people who visited them meant them harm. So we spent a few days there and, little by little, they began to trust us. We explained ‘we’re here to protect you, we are not the bad guys,’ so they understood that.\\nI have a picture taken in the village. I am sitting and a little girl is standing behind me, and she put a hand on my shoulder. It meant that even the children understood that we were there to protect them, not to harm them. That was my best day at work.\\nI like working in the deep field best of all. I used to think when I was in Colombia, Guatemala and Mozambique, ‘are they paying me to do this?’ If they had told me, ‘no, we are not going to pay you anything, you have to pay,’ I would have paid to do the work I was doing.\\nWhat was your worst day at work?\\nMy worst day was in Guatemala in 1995. It was during the civil war and I was working to protect Mayan refugees who had returned from Mexico to take part in the peace process.\\nMost of those who died in the conflict – which lasted from 1960 to 1996 – were Maya killed by the military. And we were like physical human shields between the army and the indigenous returnees. They used to alert us when soldiers entered their villages, because they were afraid of them.\\nOn this particular day, we got a call from this community who told us that the army had them surrounded. So, I drove like crazy over unpaved roads, and all the time we could hear what was happening on the radio. The soldiers were killing people.\\nJust as we were arriving, we ran into the patrol as it was leaving. They had just killed 11 people, including a child. It was like they were in a trance, they raised their guns and they could have shot us very easily. Then we arrived at the village, and it was like Dante’s Inferno. There were people crying, it was full of blood and bodies.\\nNormally we have prevented these situations, by being there physically, in the middle. But that time, we came too late. But it showed us that what we did in other villages worked. Otherwise there could have been more situations like this.\\nThe UN Refugee Agency works in 130 countries helping men, women and children driven from their homes by wars and persecution. Our headquarters are in Geneva, but 87 per cent of our staff are based in the field, helping refugees. This profile is one of a series highlighting our staff and their work.Little did he know that the process of being reunited with them would be almost as fraught as the journey over sea and land to Austria. “I couldn’t see any future for them. Our future was shattered in the ruins of Syria. This is why I came to Europe, for their sake. We were parted for two-and-a-half years,” he says.\\nUNHCR is campaigning to ease some of the practical obstacles that can make it difficult for refugees to obtain their legal entitlement to family reunification. The right to reunification applies to nuclear families, including children under 18. Some 130,000 asylum seekers arrived in Austria in 2016-17 and many received refugee status and with it the right to family reunification in a matter of months.\\nIn Mahmoud’s case, the sheer cost of travel documents was a problem and he had to take out a crippling loan to buy passports for his family. In addition, his eldest daughter Abeer had just turned 18 and strictly speaking was no longer eligible. There was a risk she would be left stranded, alone in Jordan.\\n“It has been an emotional rollercoaster for us,” admits Mahmoud’s wife, Hayat Elwees, 38, finally settled with all her children in an airy four-room apartment in Vienna.\\nBefore the Syrian war, the family lived in a house in the Damascus suburb of Sayyeda Zeinab. Mahmoud, a carpenter, had a successful windows business. “We would never have left Syria if it had not been for the war,” he says. “We had a good life there.”\\nShelling drove them first to the southwestern Syrian city of Daraa, where the couple’s youngest child, Ali, now five, was born. But then fighting engulfed Daraa and they had to flee again, this time to Jordan, where they found refuge in a camp funded by the United Arab Emirates.\\n“It was OK, caravans in the desert, about 3,500 people in the camp. But thousands more were arriving. It was not a good prospect,” says Mahmoud.\\nSyrian refugees Mahmoud Al-Bashawat and Hayat Elwees sit at home in the apartment they share with their eight children after completing the reunification process in Vienna.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Stefanie J Steindl\\nIn 2015, he took the decision to go to Europe and, as a first step, flew to Turkey.\\n“It was very hard for me when my husband left,” says Hayat. “I was all alone with my children in the camp.”\\n“We kept in touch on WhatsApp, EVERY DAY,” says 17-year-old second daughter Ghadeer emphatically.\\nHowever, Mahmoud did not tell his family when he was making the dangerous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece, as he did not want to worry them. Only when he had arrived safely did he send a photo from Greece. “I was so surprised and happy, I cried,” says Hayat.\\nMahmoud continued through the Balkans and Hungary, reaching Austria by train in September 2015. Five months later, he gained refugee status and the process of applying for family reunification could begin.\\nIn Amman, the Austrian embassy required the family to produce Syrian passports. The Syrian embassy charged US$400 dollars per passport – $3,600 dollars for nine people – money Mahmoud didn’t have. And the clock was ticking, as their Austrian visas were only valid for four months.\\n“I borrowed the money from friends, 100 dollars here, 200 dollars there, lots of very small loans,” says Mahmoud. “We didn’t understand why we couldn’t get laissez-passer travel documents. I had to pay money to the very government that was making us flee. I am still paying off the loans now.”\\n\"We couldn’t live as a family ripped apart. Family is the most precious thing.”\\nWorse was the problem that Abeer had turned 18. Initially, she received a rejection from the Austrian authorities. “I was afraid I would have to stay behind all by myself, with the rest of my family leaving,” she says.\\n“I was going crazy,” says Mahmoud. “I couldn’t abandon Abeer; I would rather have returned to Jordan. We couldn’t live as a family ripped apart. Family is the most precious thing.”\\nLuckily, with help from UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, Abeer, now 20, was included in an alternative resettlement programme. She actually arrived in Vienna on a separate flight two days before the rest of the family came this January. Now all of them are learning German.\\n“Thank God we are together, with a fresh start,” says Mahmoud. “My children saw nothing but war and missed out on their education.”\\nThe little ones are going to school and kindergarten while Abeer and Ghadeer are revising their plans.\\nGhadeer, who had hoped to be a dentist, is considering nursing. Abeer, who dreamt of being a doctor, might instead become a beautician. Soon she will also become a wife, as the family has just announced her engagement to a fellow Syrian living in Klagenfurt.\\n“Come to the wedding,” says Mahmoud expansively. “We will have a big Syrian feast.”After the outbreak of Syria’s conflict in 2011, however, he faced challenges of an altogether different kind. His pregnant wife, Enas, left their home in the Syrian city of Idlib in 2012 to stay with relatives in Egypt, while Amir and their young son Daniel remained behind.\\nBut after a rocket struck their neighbourhood close to their home, he and his son left Syria and moved to Egypt as refugees. Living in his father-in-law’s house in Alexandria with his wife, son and newborn daughter, Amir worried about how to support his young family, and became obsessed with the idea of taking the sea route to Europe.\\n“My plan was to go to Europe, to get there and then bring my family. The idea was haunting me,” Amir said. “But when I imagined leaving my wife and children behind and being away from them, or taking them with me and putting them in danger, fear was much more powerful than my hunger [to leave].”\\n“As a champion, what I have to do now is to create future champions, to continue what I have done.”\\nInstead, Amir found a job as a cashier in a local restaurant, eventually becoming a chef. By coincidence, some of his Syrian colleagues were also sportsmen, and together they came up with the idea of creating a sports centre for Syrian refugees in Alexandria.\\nIn 2015, after finding premises and organizing some sporting events, Amir and his friends approached UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, through its local NGO partner Caritas for support. UNHCR provided funds to equip the facility and offered training to Amir and his partners on managing the project.\\n“What UNHCR is trying to do with us is instead of giving us a fish every day, they taught us how to hunt,” he said. “They proposed that we train certain age groups for free for three months, and they supported us with funding while we built our name and attracted people.”\\nThe centre now offers daily classes to both Syrian refugees and local Egyptians in wrestling, kickboxing, taekwondo, karate and gymnastics, as well as women’s Zumba dance and aerobics classes run by his wife, Enas, a former ballerina.\\nAmir hopes to continue wrestling at the highest level, and still dreams of one day competing at the Olympic Games. But thanks to the academy he now has another dream: to train future champions and use sport as a means to dissuade others from risking the dangerous sea journey to Europe.\\n“As a champion, what I have to do now is to create future champions, to continue what I have done,” he explained. “To show them that you do not have to be in Germany or Britain to succeed and for people to notice your skills.”\\nAdditional reporting by Nora IbrahimSince fleeing war in Syria three years ago, the 38-year-old and his family of eight have lived precariously in Lebanon on his irregular earnings from seasonal farm work and rising levels of debt to stay afloat.\\n“I work here in the field. Sometimes I work for one, two or three hours, sometimes there is no work at all,” says Mohammed, who lives in a cluster of ramshackle shelters with 10 other Syrian refugee families in Jiyeh, a seaside town south of Lebanon’s capital, Beirut.\\n“I borrow money to buy clothes and other stuff for my children. We are big in debt. So we basically work to cover our debts.”\\nAlmost seven years since the start of the conflict in Syria, the vast majority of the roughly one million Syrian refugees registered in Lebanon now find themselves impoverished and in debt, with levels of hardship increasing each year.\\nNone\\n“Syrian refugees in Lebanon are barely keeping afloat. Most ... are extremely vulnerable and dependent on aid.\"\\nThe proportion of families living below the Lebanese poverty line of US$3.84 per person per day rose to 76 per cent in 2017, while the number in debt remained staggeringly high at 87 per cent, the Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon study found.\\nThe result is that families such as Mohammed’s are forced to make tough choices just to try to meet their most basic needs. Food insecurity affects more than nine in 10 Syrian refugee households, and Mohammed says they have had to cut down on the amount of food they eat in order to afford other essentials.\\n“We have health expenses – medicines. I have five daughters and they all go to school. We can’t stop them from receiving their education,” he explains. This mirrors one of the few bright spots in this year’s survey, which found that the proportion of children aged 6-14 enrolled in school rose to 70 per cent compared with 52 per cent last year.\\nWith vulnerability increasing according to almost all of the indicators in the report, the situation is being compounded by a shortage of funding for humanitarian assistance programmes including UNHCR’s.\\nMohammed’s situation was made worse in September when he was informed, due to a shortfall in funding for UNHCR’s humanitarian response in Lebanon, that the family would no longer be eligible for monthly cash assistance from UNHCR worth US$175.\\n“Syrian refugees in Lebanon are barely keeping afloat,” said Mireille Girard, UNHCR Representative in Lebanon. “Most families are extremely vulnerable and dependent on aid from the international community.

But up to a third, including the Awá, are at risk of extinction because of the conflict and related displacement, according to Colombia’s Constitutional Court.\\n“You have to understand that their life is based around the group,” says Harold Juajibioy, a UNHCR staffer who works with the Awá. “When the armed conflict arrives in their lands the first thing that suffers is their sense of unity. It isn’t just a harming an individual, but harming a community.”\\nIn 2011 the Constitutional Court called for the adoption of precautionary measures to protect the group. And in April last year – after six years of internal displacement – 17 displaced Awá families were given 239 hectares of land by the government in the municipality of Villagarzon, in southern Colombia’s Putumayo region, to start over.\\nThe resettled families, the first to be relocated there by the government, have gradually built elevated wooden shacks to live in. But their new homes lack running water, flushing toilets and electricity, and have black plastic trash bags covering most of the roofs to protect them from the heavy wet season rains.\\n“What does this Indigenous community need? Not just territory, we need housing, energy, water, running water in order to live, and livelihood projects so we can grow food. The government has really neglected us,” says Armando.\\n\"We need housing, energy, water, running water ... and livelihood projects so we can grow food.\"\\nTo get back on their feet, Armando says the community needs financial support to sow food crops and purchase cattle. “That is why it has been hard for us here. Some days we eat, other days we get by on a just a little coffee. That’s the situation we are living in,” he says.\\nWhile living conditions are hard, displacement for indigenous communities means more than just a loss of land. “Many times, out of fear or as a way to protect themselves, they don’t use their native language outside of their land,” says Juajibioy. “Because of discrimination in urban places, those cultural traditions, customs and rituals usually begin to disappear or deteriorate,” he adds.\\nWhile most of the homes in Villagarzon are not finished, one small but well-built wooden house stands in the middle of these lands. It is their cultural centre – built by the UN Refugee Agency – decorated and painted with the emblem of their planned indigenous reservation.\\nA marimba, a percussion instrument built from bamboo, has been placed in the centre for the community to play. “We brought the marimba from Nariño,” says Armando, “The elders taught me to play it. And now I teach my sons, so that our culture can continue.”\\nThe sun is setting and Ignacio Cuasaluzan has just come back from Mocoa, 18 kilometres Awáy.

In the chaos, she was separated from her four siblings and found her two nieces, aged four and nine, in distress on the side of the road. They sought refuge in a local village for a month before crossing to Bangladesh.\\n“It was a tough journey,” said Rabiaa, recalling the 25-day walk with nothing but the clothes on their backs. “My nieces were crying the whole time, missing their parents and little brothers.”\\nThey arrived at a transit centre run by UNHCR, a first stop for new arrivals in Bangladesh, and were given hot meals, clean water and new clothes. A week later, they moved to Kutupalong camp where they now live beside their former neighbour from Myanmar.\\n“Since we all lost our parents, I am now playing the role of a mother and they are like my little children,” said Rabiaa of the two girls. “I will take care of them for the rest of my life, even if it means that I don’t get married. I want to see them well-educated.”\\nRabiaa’s predicament is sadly far too common in the refugee camps and settlements of Cox’s Bazar, where some 650,000 refugees have arrived after fleeing violence that erupted in Myanmar in late August.\\n“Since we all lost our parents, I am now playing the role of a mother.”\\nThe UN Refugee Agency believes that children make up 55 percent of the total refugee population.

Already struggling to cover their rent, food and medical expenses, they are ill-prepared for the harsh conditions and additional costs that winter brings.\\nTheir main concern is for the welfare of their two-year-old son Haytham, who suffers from asthma and for whom the cold weather and heightened risk of infection pose a real threat.\\n“He’s had asthma since birth. When it gets bad his breathing becomes heavy and his face turns blue, and we have to give him oxygen or take him to the hospital,” Samira, 30, explains. “If he gets sick with the flu, his condition intensifies and then he can barely take a breath.”\\nIt is a similar picture across the country, where tens of thousands of Syrian refugees live in flimsy structures made of wood and plastic sheeting in informal settlements.

When it gets bad his breathing becomes heavy and his face turns blue.\"\\nTo help vulnerable refugees prepare for the cold temperatures, from November UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, began providing winter cash assistance of between US$225-375 to help with additional costs such as fuel, clothing and medical expenses. So far around 650,000 people have received such payments out of a planned total of 800,000.\\nSamira and her family, who are among the beneficiaries of the scheme, say the extra support will help keep them warm in the coming months. “For sure it will be of assistance,” she said. “For heating for example, especially with the harsh weather here, it will be of great help in dealing with my son’s condition.”\\nAcross the region as a whole, UNHCR aims to assist a total of 3.81 million Syrian and Iraqi refugees and internally displaced people with its winter assistance programme in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Egypt.\\nThe programme targets the most vulnerable families with a mixture of cash assistance, building materials to repair and weather-proof shelters, and distributions of winter items including high thermal blankets, gas heaters and warm clothes.\\nIt also includes plans to assist more than 1.1 million individuals displaced inside Syria, with priority given to those most recently displaced and others living in hard-to-reach or besieged areas.\\nAcross the region as a whole, UNHCR aims to assist a total of 3.81 million Syrians and Iraqis\\nOf the total US$228 million requested to finance this year’s winter programme, donations so far received amount to US$143 million - leaving a shortfall of around 37 per cent still needed to provide assistance to more than a million people.\\nMeanwhile, the approaching winter is also threatening the safety and welfare of refugees in other areas of the Mediterranean, including Greece, which was transited by more than 1 million people at the height of Europe’s refugee crisis.\\nUNHCR has been urging the Greek government to accelerate winter preparations for thousands of refugees and migrants in the main reception islands of Lesvos, Chios and Samos, warning of a possible repeat of the winter of 2016/17, with hundreds braving conditions in small tents and makeshift shelter.\\nNone\\nUNHCR has also helped directly by more than 240,000 aid items to authorities to be used on the islands, including tents and winter clothing, and continues to support the transfer of people to the mainland to avoid winter spent in unheated tents with poor facilities.\\nAlmost 20,000 have come to the islands since July.

Over 37 per cent of citizens count themselves Catholic while 14 per cent are Protestants – Calvinists or Lutherans.

They were asking, ‘what kind of water should we give the refugees, still or sparkling? And what kind of food do Muslims eat?’.”\\nThe Catholics were more cautious. Bishop Beer admits that while he felt the building of a fence on the border with Serbia “did not give out a good message”, he was initially inclined to give the government the benefit of the doubt when it came to ensuring orderly migration.\\nBut he was shocked by billboards and other propaganda that aimed to turn the population against refugees. In 2016, the government urged a “no” vote in a referendum on whether Hungary should take its EU quota of refugees. In the end, the vote was invalidated due to low turnout.\\n“Who came up with the idea of playing on the negative instincts of the people, on their egoism and selfishness?” the bishop asks. “Without doubt, the government campaign has had an impact on the population and I am afraid that people have started to see enemies everywhere.”\\nThe bishop sighs and struggles to explain the negative attitudes he comes across. “With a heavy heart, I must say it is rare when I meet churchgoers who understand (the need to help refugees) and this applies to priests too. Perhaps the roots are in the old dictatorship.

Villagers attacked a guesthouse owner who had offered holiday accommodation to a group of refugees.\\n“These refugees had actually been granted asylum by the government,” says Bishop Beer. “But this is what Hungarian society is like now. We do not care about others. There is just automatic rejection of outsiders.”\\nHe adds that rural Hungary is depopulated and many village houses are abandoned. “I cannot live with the idea that it is better for these buildings to collapse than to let refugees live there,” he says.\\n“I am best serving the government if I speak the truth.”\\nReligious leaders are aware that there could be some risk in challenging the government over refugees, not least because churches depend on the state for finance.\\n“The government has not said it will cut funds and I don’t raise the matter either,” says Bishop Fabiny. “But some of my pastors worry that we could be punished financially. I am responsible for the unity of my church. I have to hear their voices and I must be fair to the government too. It is a very narrow path.”\\nFor his part, Bishop Beer says: “I am best serving the government if I speak the truth.”\\nWhen it comes to giving practical support to refugees, the Lutheran Church runs a centre in Budapest where asylum seekers can get help with translations and legal advice.

Besides adjusting to a new environment still rife with security problems and a severe lack of infrastructure, Fadumo quickly realised that she needed a job to help her take care of her three young sons.\\n“I can afford food, I am able to pay rent and take my eldest son to school.”\\nShe learned of a centre in Kismayo that supports returnees. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, funds the Returnee Support Centre which is run by the American Refugee Committee (ARC) -- an international non-governmental organization that supports returnees in Somalia in partnership with UNHCR.\\nFadumo registered for courses in computer literacy and technical vocational education and training (TVET). The three-month course taught her tie-and-dye skills and, soon after completing her training, she took out a US$500 loan through ARC’s micro finance programme.\\nShe started her own business and now runs a busy workshop, making beautiful garments that she sells in the local market. She also started a small grocery shop selling fruit and vegetables.\\nMore than a year later, Fadumo has found success, and sense of belonging, for the first time in her life.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Life here is much better than in the refugee camp,” she says. “I can afford food, I am able to pay rent and take my eldest son to school.”\\nShe has also been steadily repaying the loan, made possible by the daily income she generates from her two businesses.\\n“Most returnees do not have the right skills to get gainful employment when they return,” said William Ejalu, the head of UNHCR’s sub office, in Mogadishu. “TVET is therefore a handy tool that helps them acquire the right skills and provides them an equal opportunity to compete for jobs.”\\nThe support centre was set up last year when the first group of returnees started to arrive in large numbers in Somalia. Since then, through the programme UNHCR has been able to support 1,200 returnees, including 100 in Kismayo alone. The trainees receive cash grants to start businesses and are supported by regular visits from their trainers.\\nSomalia: Returning refugees rebuild their lives and country\\xa0(Mary Theru, producer / Mohamed Sheikh Nor, camera / Arnold Temple, editor)\\nMohamed* another beneficiary of the TVET programme, returned to Somalia last December. He left his home town in Jamame for Dadaab at the height of the 2011 drought with his wife, his brother’s widow and her four children.\\nReturning to his homeland was always on his mind.\\n“The prevailing mood in the country was of optimism and peace,” he says. “So, we decided to come back home.”\\nLike Fadumo, he was faced with no prospect of an income and struggled to readjust to life back in Somalia, taking care of his brother’s family and his own. Through the TVET programme, his optimism was rekindled.\\n“The agency really came to our aid and showed us all the opportunities available for us to establish a new life in the town,” he explains, referring to the support he received through the centre.\\nHe graduated in June with skills in carpentry, and has started a small business making high-quality picture frames. He sells the frames for between US$10 and US$22 each, making a good profit. Mohamed’s products are so popular that the ARC and the centre have commissioned him to make frames for their offices.\\nSince December 2014, when the voluntary return exercise was officially launched, more than 75,000 Somalis have returned from Kenya’s Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps. UNHCR issues returnees with a package consisting of a cash allowance to sustain them for the first six months in Somalia and support to start businesses.\\nHowever, the scale of returns to Somalia continues to be restricted since some areas in the country are still not safe for the millions that have been displaced. More than one\\xa0million are internally displaced within Somalia and nearly another million are refugees.\\nAccording to Mohamed Affey, UNHCR’s Special Envoy on the Somali refugee situation, more needs to be done by the international community to support safe and dignified returns.\\n“Conditions need to improve in Somalia and this requires resources,” he says. “There needs to be a sincere commitment to mobilize resources that will allow the people to develop their country.”\\nAffey adds that returns will be viable only if the international community is strongly committed to a comprehensive approach to make conditions in Somalia safe for return.\\n“I feel welcome back here and, with my new skills, I can make a living.”\\nUNHCR and its partners are working to support programmes and strengthen systems to aid returnees’ transition back into their communities.\\n“These programmes are essential for ensuring that Somalis who voluntarily return are able to readjust to a new life and start the process of rebuilding their lives,” says UNHCR’s Ejalu.\\nMohamed and Fadumo believe they are helping to rebuild their country, too.\\n“I feel welcome back here and with my new skills, I can make a living,” says Mohamed. He gives motivational talks at the centre where he shares his experiences. “This process has been an eye-opener and a reason to have hope in the future.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs UNHCR and its partners continue to support returnees such as Fadumo and Mohamed, more needs to be done to ensure these returns are sustainable. Conditions should be right, and returnees should feel safe and have access to education, health and most importantly, an income. Only then can all those returning to Somalia echo Fadumo’s sentiments.\\nFadumo is happy to be back in her home country, where feels a sense of freedom. “It is an extraordinary happiness.”\\n(Additional reporting and research by Mary Theru and Cathy Wachiaya in Nairobi)\\n*Names changed for protection reasons“Whenever I go to school, the children insult me and take away my scarf,” she says, gripping the scarf that partially hides her face. “They tell me to uncover my mouth. I am scared because I don’t want them to see me.”\\nBarwako’s mother, Kadija Hussen Abdi, has struggled to find the right medical care for her daughter. To add to her misery, the family faced threats from Al Shabaab militants in 2010, forcing them to leave Somalia and flee to Ethiopia.\\n“They beat me several times and even came twice to my home asking where my husband was,” she says. “They warned me that, if they returned and he wasn’t there, they would take me.”\\nWhile on the move, Barwako’s condition worsened. Once in Ethiopia, the family was able to get the disease under control, but unfortunately Barwako lost her lower lip.\\n“They said that there’s nothing they can do in the country.”\\nYears of countless visits to different doctors in Addis Ababa in the hope of obtaining effective treatment have yielded no long-lasting results.\\n“She has gone through many referrals and hospitals,” Kadija says, gesturing towards Barwako. “They said that there’s nothing they can do in the country.”\\nFinally, there is hope. Barwako and her family have been selected to relocate to Italy as part of a Humanitarian Corridors Programme, supported by the Italian government and led by Italian faith-based organizations.\\nWith the community of Sant\\'Egidio in Italy, the Italian Bishops’ Conference through its humanitarian organizations Caritas Italiana and Migrantes are helping Barwako move to a country where she will finally receive the medical attention she needs. She is one of 2,500 people around the world that Italy has agreed to take in under the programme.\\nEthiopia: Vulnerable refugees given new home and hope in Italy\\xa0(Diana Diaz, camera-editor)\\nNone\\nAn important objective of the CRRF and the global compact on refugees is to expand refugees\\' access to third countries through resettlement or other forms of admission, such as Italy\\'s Humanitarian Corridors Programme.\\n“I wish I can get my mouth fixed so that I can pursue my education and become a teacher.”\\nNone\\nBy opening up options for the some of the most vulnerable to move to third countries under the Humanitarian Corridors Programme, Italy is helping in the global effort for more comprehensive responses to refugees. Through the programme, 500 refugees living in Ethiopia who are vulnerable because of personal circumstances, age or health, or who have family ties in Italy, will have an opportunity to rebuild their lives.\\nKadija can now picture a better life for her daughter.\\n“I dream of going to a place where everyone around me helps me find a home and find peace,” she says. “Somewhere where she can get medication and we can be happy.”\\nBarwako is on the verge of seeing her dream come true and starting a new life.\\n“I wish I can get my mouth fixed so that I can go to school, pursue my education and become a teacher,” she says.Forced to marry a man against her will at a very young age, Layla promised herself that she would not sit back while other women went through similar experiences. “I remember seeing my neighbour beaten up by her brother because she refused to get married,” she recalled. “She felt her life was over. I accompanied her to the hospital, and helped her rent a house far from danger.”\\nThis was the first in a long list of acts that ultimately put Layla herself at risk, forcing her to escape to Jordan two years ago for her own safety. “I received daily threats, usually through letters, and more than once strangers waited for me outside my office,” she said. “I know I can never be safe wherever I go, as the people who want to silence me could find me easily.”\\nLayla attended a class with 25 refugee women of all ages from five different countries at the SheFighter studio in the Jordanian capital Amman. Created in 2012 by Jordanian entrepreneur Lina Khalifeh, the SheFighter technique combines several martial arts and teaches women how to defend themselves against attackers, while building up their self-esteem in the process.\\n“I received daily threats ... and more than once strangers waited for me outside my office.”\\nNone\\nThis year, UNHCR Jordan adopted the global campaign theme “Leave No One Behind: end violence against women and girls,” joining worldwide efforts to combat the violence that can have lifelong consequences for women and girls, their families and communities.\\nThe class was a new experience for Layla, who has spent so many years fighting on behalf of others. “Everyone here has a story, and we can share and learn from each other,” she said. “Suffering can create a new woman; suffering created me. Women can change the world and be who they want to be.”\\nNone\\nGlobally, around one in three women will experience physical or sexual abuse during their lifetime, according to UN Women, the United Nations organization dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. During times of displacement, the risk of violence against women and girls is exacerbated.\\nNadia, 58, is a refugee and former university professor from the Iraqi capital, Baghdad. She was unable to teach during four years of war and was finally forced to seek asylum in Jordan.\\n“Self-defence classes give refugee women the confidence to believe in their own strength.”\\n“I am alone, I feel alone,” she said. “When you leave your country as a divorced woman, starting a new life as a refugee is hard.” Nadia surprised herself in the class, finding she was stronger and more agile than she thought. “I learned the weak points of the attackers, and it was a good opportunity to meet new people and discuss topics that affect us all.”\\nIn addition to boosting confidence and self-esteem, practising martial arts is also credited with reducing stress and decreasing feelings of anger and frustration.\\nIn 2017, UNHCR has stepped up its work to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls – including through measures to tackle rape, sexual assault, child marriage, partner violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, and female genital mutilation.\\n“Refugee women and girls are at a much higher risk of gender-based violence due to displacement, as they often lose their support network in the country of asylum and find themselves in a difficult socio-economic situation,” explained Emilie Page, UNHCR sexual and gender-based violence officer in Jordan.\\n“Responding to the individual needs of survivors is essential and life-saving, but prevention programs focusing on women’s empowerment are equally important,” she said. “Self-defence classes give refugee women the confidence to believe in their own strength. Their courage is an inspiration to all of us.”\\nSelf-defence classes are part of a wider UNHCR push to empower vulnerable refugee women and girls across the region, and reduce the risks of violence and exploitation they face. The drive includes cash assistance, skills training and provision of safe spaces.\\n*Names changed for protection reasons.None\\nNone\\nNone\\nWhy did you become an aid worker?\\nI think I was destined to work with refugees. I was an urban refugee in Kenya, having left South Sudan when I was very young. I was a UNHCR beneficiary – UNHCR sponsored my primary education. I got to know about UNHCR at an early age.\\nIn addition to that, my mother later joined the World Food Programme in South Sudan. When I went to visit her at work, she would be involved in programmes like food distribution. Seeing people receive the food aid, and how they appreciated what they were receiving, made me want to do what she was doing. I saw the sense of satisfaction she got from her job. It motivated me to follow in her footsteps.\\nWhat is the most rewarding/challenging thing about your job? \\nIn just three months, more than 600,000 Rohingya refugees have fled violence in Myanmar to seek safety in Bangladesh. What is shocking to me about this emergency is how fast it has been growing. While it is growing very fast, the resources are not keeping up. We are giving a lot, yet it feels like a drop in the ocean.\\nLogistically, it means more work for us at our warehouse, because we are bagging up various aid items like jerry cans, plastic sheets, blankets, mosquito nets, cooking pots and solar lanterns. But when it comes to distribution, it is easier. In the camps, refugees have to walk long distances to pick up aid items. So having the items already in kit form makes it easier for them to carry.\\nRobina at work in the UNHCR warehouse in Cox\\'s Bazar, Bangladesh. \\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR\\nThe job needs you to be strong, and have an authoritative voice. You are dealing with people, mainly men, from different backgrounds – from labourers to loaders, truck drivers, to managers. You need to have all these characteristics, which I think women have.\\nWhat was the best day you had at work? \\nI had just started my career in the United Nations when we were involved in the repatriation of refugees from Uganda to South Sudan. When I saw them return, they had that feeling of coming home. They had possessions that they brought back with them, and they were so happy to be back in their own land.\\nWe were not doing much for them – we were distributing tools and seedlings – but what I saw in their faces was a hope for a new and better tomorrow. That was the best day of my life. Especially for myself, coming from the same community, it felt like things were changing for the better.\\nWhat was the worst day at work?\\nActually, it is related to what I said is the best day of my career. It was when I saw that hope begin to crumble in late 2013, when fighting broke out in South Sudan again. I happened to drive along the road exiting town, and there were all these families walking with mattresses on their heads, buckets, all their belongings – leaving South Sudan, trying to cross the border into Uganda. It was just a few years before that they were coming back home, and now they were leaving their home again. That was painful for me.\\nNone“The roof was destroyed by the wind,” recalls 25-year-old Eli. “Afterwards we had to cover the house with grass.”\\nYears ago, the camp would have been protected from the elements by trees. However, a major influx of refugees from neighbouring Burundi and the DRC has increased the pressure on limited resources and aggravated environmental challenges faced by the host community. Acres of trees have been cut down to make way for agriculture and to supply firewood and timber. Now refugees and communities are bearing the brunt.\\n\"It’s more important to me now that there are trees.”\\nThere is hope. For the past three months, Eli has been working at a tree nursery in Nyarugusu camp, where about 800,000 seedlings are being grown on half an acre of land. Once rooted, they will be transferred to the camp and host community.\\nAbout 100 refugees like Eli, as well as local people, are learning new skills and earning a regular monthly income.\\n“Normally I do watering and weeding,” says Eli, tending to some newly planted papaya trees in a peaceful clearing. “I’m really enjoying working here and it’s more important to me now that there are trees.”\\nHamilton Misana has led the project for CEMDO, a partner of UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, since 2014. “Resources are limited, but we train workers on watering, insect management and weeding,” he says. “We also educate locals and refugees on planting trees, water conservation and bush fires, and mobilize them to do business that is environmentally friendly, such as beekeeping.”\\nWith more than 316,000 refugees living in camps in Tanzania, Hamilton knows how important cooperation with the host community can be. “We have to work together,” he says.\\nUNHCR and partner organizations are working to make a difference for everyone. Besides the two nurseries at Nyarugusu, an additional 100,000 trees have been raised in a nursery in Nduta Refugee Camp with support from REDESO. These will be planted\\xa0in the camp by the refugee community.\\nAnother 54,000 have been planted at a nursery in Biturana village, a 30-minute drive from Nduta. There, local people like Jovin Nyanenda, 27, gain new skills and soon every household will receive 30 seedlings.\\n“UNHCR trained me with new skills in how to raise seedlings, mix the soil and maintain the nursery,” says Jovin, wiping his brow. “I’m very happy to have the trees around again. It is not only benefitting me, but everyone.”\\n\"It is not only benefitting me, but everyone.”\\nIn total, UNHCR has planted about 2 million trees in Nyarugusu, Nduta and Mtendeli refugee camps. Seeds are acquired through its partners CEMDO and REDESO from local dealers, boosting cooperation with the private sector.\\nHowever, every seedling costs 250 Tanzanian shillings (Tzs) (10 US cents) and funding is limited. More is urgently needed to continue important projects like these, which are key to the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF), a new approach that focuses on supporting communities hosting large numbers of refugees and implementing sustainable programmes as early as possible.\\nTanzania: Tree project grows hope for refugee and host communities\\xa0(William Davies, producer-camera)\\nEnergy needs in the camps are high and, even for fast growing tree species, it can take three years before a tree is ready to use as firewood.\\nMany refugees, forced to start from scratch and with little alternative, have spent decades using Tanzania’s trees for firewood and timber.\\xa0 As supplies have dwindled, tension with local communities has grown as they try to meet their own energy and timber needs from the same limited resources.\\nStella Ndayishimiye, 27, is a mother of two, who until recently regularly left the camp in search of firewood. It is a dangerous and exhausting task, taking up to five hours. She was among a group of women who were beaten by local people.\\n“The beating took a long time,” she recalls. “Some of us were cut with knives and some were taken to hospital. The children were with me. Even now, I still feel the pain in my body and in my head.”\\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas is an alternative fuel source being trialled by UNHCR at Nyarugusu and Mtendeli. Each week, more than 3,000 households receive a 6-kg canister of gas, a safer, healthier and more sustainable alternative to firewood. It reduces emissions and improves air quality in shelters.\\n“It is better to have the gas,” says Stella, firmly, as she waits in line with other women. “Now I don’t have to fear because I don’t have to go out into the bush and get attacked.”\\n“Now I don’t have to fear.\"\\nLack of funding, however, means this project may be short-lived. It costs UNHCR 47,000 Tzs\\xa0(US$21) for one canister of gas, and 20,500 Tzs\\xa0(US$9) to refill it each time. More than 3,000 households are reaping the benefits, but that is still a tiny percentage of the refugee population. Much more needs to be done to save the natural environment.\\nNone\\n“One of the main goals of the strategy is to provide all households with access to alternative cooking fuels and linking the intervention with increased livelihood opportunities so that the beneficiaries can contribute towards the cost and sustainability of this important programme,” she said.\\nThese projects are examples of the kind of thing that need to be replicated and scaled up, as UNHCR leads the process to develop a global compact on refugees, designed to ensure that host countries have the support to manage the effects, including environmental issues, of large numbers of refugees.\\nThis might cover access to affordable, clean and sustainable energy in refugee camps or investment in environmental technologies that benefit refugees and host communities alike.\\nNone\\nFor Wizeyimana Siwajibu, 34, a Burundian refugee who tends seedlings at Nduta’s tree nursery, such projects are life-changing.\\n“I’m proud to have the chance to work here,” she says, smiling. “I used to walk for around three hours to collect firewood and this project is helping us to keep the trees. I’m really very thankful.”“Look at them, all working!” he says, watching his bees take off and land at hives carefully arrayed behind the apple trees. “I never thought bees could be so successful in this climate.”\\nGiven bees’ usual intolerance of dampness, Alsous remains astonished at the hardiness of Britain’s native black bee, a furry relative of strains from Germany and the Baltics that long ago adapted to the British Isles.\\n“Syrian bees can’t go out in even the lightest rain,” he added. “If it’s 15 degrees, there is no activity. But here, they work normally if it’s 15 degrees, or even 13 degrees – even in the rain!\"\\nIn England, a buzzing business for Syrian refugee beekeeper\\xa0(Dalal Mawad, producer / Bela Szandelszky, camera-editor)\\nOnce a professor of agriculture at Damascus University, Alsous, 64, arrived as a refugee in the United Kingdom four years ago. Abandoning his research into beekeeping and environmental pollution, he fled Syria for his life after his family received death threats and his car was bombed.\\nIn July 2013, he joined his wife in Huddersfield, the West Yorkshire city where their daughter Razan had settled. Razan, who had arrived the previous year, is something of a local celebrity, appearing on a national television cooking show thanks to the award-wining halloumi produced by her company, Yorkshire Dama Cheese.\\nBack in Syria, Alsous had managed 500 beehives whose colonies, derived from the Italian and Carniolan strains, produced at least 10 tonnes of honey a year. In addition to his research at the university, he ran a company selling herbal and honey-based cosmetics.\\nA passion for honeybees was one of the few things he brought with him when he left. Even his precious steel-and-rubber bee smoker had to be conveyed from Syria by a friend later.\\n“I needed only one hive to start.”\\nIn the UK, it took time for him to find his feet. He knew some English but lacked contact with native speakers. And he was rejected as overqualified each time he applied for a job.\\nEventually, he approached the Huddersfield Beekeepers’ Association to volunteer. There, he made friends and contacts, but still he was a beekeeper without any bees.\\n“I needed only one hive to start,” he said. Finally, he posted an advertisement on Facebook asking if anyone had a hive to donate.\\nThree weeks later, in September 2015, a woman from Manchester replied. She offered a hive, and to his delight, a colony of British black bees, believed until recently to be all but extinct in Britain.\\n“That first hive, I\\'ve split it seven times,” said Alsous proudly, referring to a method used by beekeepers to prevent “swarming” – when bees take off to nest in the wild. “Really it is like a treasure,” he said. “My aim is to cooperate with the community to improve the strain.”\\nAlsous’ apiary now comprises 17 hives, which he builds from recycled materials.\\nShocked to learn the United Kingdom imports 90 per cent of its honey requirements, according to industry data, he believes Britain’s rapeseed fields and banks of heather and lavender could support many more hives.\\nIt was only when he attended a monthly dinner held for refugees and new arrivals in the Huddersfield region, that his idea started to take shape. There he met two women, Jean York and Jane Wood, who work with refugees in the district of Kirklees, a member of the grassroots City of Sanctuary movement in the UK which helps new arrivals fit in.\\n“This lit it up for me,” said York, remembering her first conversation with Alsous, when he raised the possibility of teaching beekeeping to refugees and jobseekers.\\n“If someone asks for help, why not give it?”\\nGeof Hughes, a local beekeeper who met Alsous through the Huddersfield association, was similarly impressed. “I really valued the idea,” said Hughes. “I wanted to help.”\\nLast year, they and Alsous assembled a steering committee and got to work. The Buzz Project was born.\\nKickstarted with local funding, the project has just given the second of its fortnightly workshops to 12 volunteers. Attendees included three Syrian women, a Congolese refugee with memories of gathering honey in the jungle, and a Nigerian student, who was already asking how to get her first queen.\\nAfter a chance encounter with the Huddersfield mayor, Jim Dodds, the project really took off.\\nAlsous was offered a base for next summer in the nearby village of Standedge, where he will install 10 hives and demonstrate beekeeping to visitors.\\nUntil then, his apiary remains divided between its warmer wintering spot in the Armitage Bridge orchard and a grassy space lent to him by a local mechanic.\\n“If someone asks for help, why not give it?” said Ted Mankowski, the orchard’s owner who has lived in England for 30 years. “In Poland, my uncle used to have bees.”\\nEven in the safety of the UK, Alsous cannot forget his homeland, which had half a million hives before the war. Those colonies, he says, have all but collapsed. “I hope to go back one day and help to rebuild. It is very important.”Leading this joyful ensemble is 45-year-old Syrian refugee Ehsan Al Khalili, his hands a well-practised blur of movement across the drum skin. His music class is aimed at children with disabilities living in the camp, but is open to all and hugely popular, judging by how quickly the plastic chairs in front of him fill up at the start of each session.\\nEhsan’s belief in the positive effects of music began during his childhood in the Syrian capital, Damascus. “When I was 11, I was riding a bicycle with friends and fell into a large construction hole in the street,\" he explained. \"Head injuries caused nerve damage in my eyes and I lost my sight.\"\\nAfter quitting school and falling into depression, Ehsan made a conscious decision to begin a new life. He asked his father to buy him a cassette player and began listening to Egyptian songs, eventually teaching himself to drum by playing along in time with the music.\\nAfter enrolling aged 16 in a school for pupils with visual impairments, Ehsan joined a school band as its drummer and singer. He proposed that the band, whose male members were all blind, could play to female guests at traditional weddings where men and women remain separate, thus carving out a successful niche.\\n“From being a need... music became my profession.\"\\nEhsan continued to work as a musician for several years, running his own band which played at restaurants, parties and weddings in the capital. “From being a need, then a hobby, music became my profession,” he said.\\nAged 23, he married his wife Rabab, and music took a back seat after he found a job in a government office helping people with their passport applications. Following the outbreak of conflict in Syria in 2011, however, Ehsan lost his job. A year later, he was woken by Rabab one morning to the sound of explosions drawing nearer and nearer to their home.\\nThe couple and their five children fled to Jordan and became refugees. They spent their first three years in exile living in towns and cities around the country and getting by on financial assistance provided by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.\\nEhsan often found life difficult in his new and unfamiliar urban surroundings. “There were days when I thought: ‘this is it, this is the end’. Sometimes I didn’t leave the apartment for weeks at a time.”\\nThe World Health Organization estimates that 15 per cent of the world’s population has some form of disability. In situations of forced displacement, people with disabilities often face additional barriers to accessing services and have few opportunities to play an active role in their communities.\\nNone\\nEhsan’s situation changed in 2015, when he and his family moved to Azraq refugee camp in Jordan’s barren north-eastern desert, home to more than 35,000 Syrian refugees.\\n“The best way to fight misconceptions is for people to see you engaged.\"\\nThere he met Abu Hassan, a fellow resident who plays the oud – a traditional lute – and the two began playing music together “for the sheer joy of it”. The pair approached a UNHCR-funded community centre in the camp run by humanitarian organization CARE International, and suggested starting a music class for children, including those with disabilities.\\n“People with disabilities have talents that need to be expressed,” Ehsan said, adding that activities that take account of their needs are necessary to integrate people with disabilities fully into the community.\\nThat was certainly the case for Ehsan himself, who said that becoming a music teacher has “allowed me to give something back to my community and become the person I’ve always wanted to be\".\\nHe hopes his example is helping to fight common misunderstandings about people with disabilities.\\n“The main struggle I’ve faced during my life is how other people treat me, like I’m somehow incapable,” he said. “The best way to fight misconceptions is for people to see you engaged in life. When they see me teaching or playing with the band, they begin to understand that I’m not defined by my disability.”\\n\\xa0Here are some key moments in the first 100 days of the emergency.\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nDuring the week of the announcement, an average of 100 families – some 430 individuals – per day entered Bangladesh as the tragic crisis, unprecedented in the region in decades, continues.\\nNone“Anyone can walk in,” says 21-year-old Sandrine, pointing to the loose canvas flap that gives access to the tiny section where she, her husband and their newborn baby sleep. “I’m still scared from before, and here I don’t feel any better. It doesn’t feel safe.”\\nEmergency shelters like these provide little comfort, privacy or security. Inside the huge tented structure, divided into about 30 dwellings, mosquitoes keep the inhabitants awake at night and intense heat builds up during the day. When it rains, water runs across the bare\\xa0earth floor.\\n\"There are so many diseases, we need better conditions.”\\n“My husband has gone to hospital,” says Sandrine. “He’s got stomach cramps and the flu. We don’t live properly. There are so many diseases, we need better conditions.”\\nOne-month-old Promence’s hoarse cries confirm that she, too, has flu.\\nNyarugusu camp opened more than 20 years ago and now accommodates nearly 150,000 refugees from the DRC and Burundi. Tanzania hosts a total of 359,494 people of concern, including refugees and asylum-seekers.\\nFurther funding is urgently needed so that people like Sandrine and her baby can be moved quickly into safer, more solid structures. A growing shortfall means that, in the country’s refugee camps, hundreds of thousands of people are suffering. Better protected transitional shelters, costing US$500 each to build, are in short supply.\\nChansa Kapaya, the Tanzania representative of UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, says that, by the end of the year, the agency and its partners hope to have built some 18,000 sun-dried mud brick transitional shelters with metal roofs. This is still only 38 per cent of what is needed. An additional 30,550 transitional shelters are required, at a total cost of about US$15,275,000.\\n“Refugees who fled their homes in Burundi and DRC and sought asylum in Tanzania lost everything and came with literally nothing,” she says. “Shelter is one of the many basic needs we try to provide every family. Adequate shelter is a basic human right and basic necessity that every human being requires. Providing adequate shelter for each refugee family is a big challenge due to funding constraints.”\\nIn Nduta camp, which houses 125,000 refugees, three-quarters of the population are women and children. Only 34 per cent of households live in transitional shelters.\\nThere, Venansiya Bigirimana, 28, and her sister Mariana Kamanzi, 30, have been living in a torn, dilapidated tent for 10 months since they arrived from Burundi. Nine people – the two sisters and their seven boys – share the cramped space. There are no beds, just the ground to sleep on, and both of Venensiya’s twins, born just five months ago, have chest infections. Her husband died in Burundi.\\n\"Shelter is one of the many basic needs we try to provide every family.\"\\n“It’s hard because you can see the situation, how we live, how we sleep,” says Mariana, whose husband is still in Burundi. “It leaks when it rains and it’s cold in the night.

In\\xa0the meantime, they will struggle through the rain, without shoes, lighting, enough food or even a mattress.\\nIn Nduta camp, UNHCR is working hard to move people out of emergency shelters by providing some refugees with the tools and materials to build their own homes through a community-based approach. Under this “upgradable shelter” project, emergency shelters can be encased by mud-bricks and upgraded into semi-permanent structures with a corrugated iron roof.\\n“I’m waiting for somewhere safe to go.\"\\n“The main problem is the lack of transitional shelters in Nduta camp,” says Patrick Mutai, UNHCR’s shelter officer in the camp. “We have refugees living in tents and emergency shelters for over a year and they deteriorate in time. The benefits of this project are that it is cheaper than doing the full construction, refugees can do it by themselves and they learn the skills.”\\nNone\\nIn Tanzania, each shelter built under the community-based approach costs 50 per cent less than full construction of a transitional shelter, which means funds can be used to meet other important needs such as health care, education and livelihoods. And, in Nduta camp at least, it is working. Since April 2017, the number of households living in transitional shelters\\xa0there has increased by 13 per cent.\\nIn Nyarugusu camp, only 6,159 households have access to transitional shelters. Though less expensive, they require funding that the operation does not have. Until more funds are found, Sandrine and thousands of others face a long and frightening wait in the emergency shelter. For her, it is the nights and the darkness that are the worst.\\n“We have the one torch but the batteries have finished and we can’t buy more,” she says, gently rocking baby Promence. “I’m waiting for somewhere safe to go.”At the end of the performance there is a standing ovation for American composer Todd Fletcher and the multicultural cast of “Hoch Hinaus” (“Flying High”).\\nThe night before, Fletcher, 48, a Harvard graduate with 35 musicals to his credit, was sleepless with worry about his latest high-risk venture: putting refugees with little knowledge of Western music or the German language on stage in Berlin, Hamburg and Leipzig.\\nYet the gamble has paid off, with a successful touring show that tells anew the age-old story of the battle between good and evil.\\nHow music and dance are helping refugees integrate in Germany\\xa0(Sylvie Francis, producer)\\n“I’m in the bad army, dressed in black,” says Rahman Yaqoubi, 17, an Afghan who grew up in exile in Iran. “I like Justin Bieber, Michael Jackson – how he dances. There was no chance for me to perform in Iran. It is good fun to work with Herr Todd. Herr Todd is a diamond.”\\nFletcher was raised in Connecticut, steeped in the passion, spectacle and music of the southern Baptist churches. He has lived in Germany since 2006, working on various youth projects. “Hoch Hinaus” is the fruit of cooperation between his own company, PluralArts International, and the German Catholic charity Malteser Hilfsdienst.\\n“I have a friend who was running a shelter,” says Fletcher. “I was curious about the refugees but had never met any. I saw them lying on their beds, whiling away their time with their phones – hundreds of able-bodied, intelligent men with nothing to do. I thought it was such a waste of talent.”\\nSo he had the idea of writing a musical for them.\\n“Hoch Hinaus” is roughly based on the experiences of the refugees, exploring themes such as friendship, freedom and betrayal. A fantasy, with echoes of “The Wizard of Oz” and “Alice in Wonderland”, it tells how a group of innocent villagers, dressed in white, are captured by the forces of the Little Witch, dressed in black.\\nThe villagers are held hostage in the mountains and forced to take part in the witch’s tea party until the hero, Maher, with help from Princess Deyse, comes to the rescue and the warring sides are reconciled.\\nMany asylum seekers who arrived in Europe in 2015 were young men, so most of the female parts in the musical are taken by Germans, with refugees filling the male roles. However, refugee women are also involved. Others are helping make the costumes using skills honed back in their home countries.\\nLearning the lyrics has been a good way for the refugees to improve their German, an essential part of their integration – though only the “goodies” sing in German, while the villains speak English.\\nRehearsals have been taking place for months. As well as coaching the refugees he recruited in Berlin, Fletcher has been travelling every Monday to rehearse with youngsters in Hamburg.\\nAs rehearsals entered in their final week at Berlin’s ufaFabrik cultural centre, the pressure was on. “It seems all I do is scream, scream, scream at them,” says Fletcher. Nevertheless, the performers were loving it. “I feel happiness when I am singing,” says Kim Saad, 30, a Palestinian who lived in Libya before coming to Europe. Older than the others, he plays an elderly man. “I have been under a lot of stress because I lost my wife and daughter in the war in Libya. The musical has helped me.”\\nNastassja Selow, 14, plays the witch. “This has been so much fun,” she says. “I’ve never played this kind of role and I’ve not really met refugees before. We have made friends. I don’t want it to end because then I won’t see them every week.”\\nFletcher calls the cast to order. “Right everyone,” he says. “We have seven minutes to learn something new but it’s super easy.\\n‘Lift your voices and sing!\\nWe no longer have to wait now,\\nWe are stronger. Stand up straight now!\\nWe have turned the golden key,\\nWe’re finally free…’”\\nWithin minutes, the cast had picked up the new steps to with the song.\\nWith only hours to go until the premiere, Maher was nervous. “I don’t have a perfect voice but Todd said we can all sing, so I gave it a go and it’s been great,” says the hero of the piece.\\n\"I know one day we will go home and build our country again.\"\\n“In the story, I’m the loser. I’m afraid of everything – except that I know languages and can read maps, so I am able to save the others. But I don’t see myself as the star. I am not alone on the stage.”\\nPerhaps the real hero is Reza Yaqoubi, 17. At short notice, he stepped in to replace a cast member who fell ill and managed to learn the key role of Reza the Traitor in just a week.\\n“Music is a language for everyone,” he says modestly. “Music is a feeling we can all understand.”\\nIt was time for the curtain up.\\nHoch Hinaus has some beautiful songs – “The Travel Prayer”, which combines Islamic, Christian and Jewish prayers for safe travels; “Always and Everywhere”, in which the white warrior Khaled promises to be there always for his friend; and “I Never Knew”, the love duet between Princess Deyse and Maher.\\nFletcher has allowed the refugees’ talent to blossom. “My motto,” he says, “is Benjamin Disraeli’s saying: ‘The greatest good you can do for another is not to share your riches but reveal to him his own.\\'”\\nThe refugees seem stunned by the thunderous applause that greets the closing chorus, “Finally Free”.\\nHowever, “Finally Free” is not quite the end. The musical finishes with Maher going back up the mountain to liberate others who remain in bondage.\\nMaher, who arrived in Germany by train in 2015, sees meaning in every note of the musical. “I lost friends in Syria,” he says. “When I came to Munich station, I would have sung ‘Finally Free’ if I had I known it then. Now I am in Germany, studying. But like every Syrian, I know one day we will go home and build our country again, and make a completely different future.”With hard work, determination and a helping hand from Costa Rican authorities and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, they have built a successful bakery.\\n“We came with the desire, and still have the determination, to strive do something, to work and to keep moving ahead,” says Miriam.\\nServing up gluten-free versions of traditional Colombian treats – such as almojábanas, a dumpling shaped cheese bread – they have carved out a niche for themselves in the capital, San José.\\nCosta Rica has developed standout systems of protection allowing refugees to flourish.

The festival is a citizen-led initiative by a French NGO called Food, Sweet Food and was jointly organized along with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.\\nOver a week, three refugee chefs from Yemen, Syria and Iran cooked lunch for 1,500 students in four schools in Calvados.\\n“I will tell my parent that I want to try to cook the same recipe at home.”\\nThe schoolchildren clear away their empty plates but keep the table mats, specially designed for the event, and fold them up to take them home. The mats show a map of Yemen and the distance from France, and give information on the definition of a refugee, how many refugees live in France and the reasons why they were forced to flee their homes.\\n“I am taking the table mat because I want to show it to my parents,” says Margot, one of the pupils. “I will tell them that it was very, very good and that I want to try to cook the same recipe at home.”\\nThe event, taking place alongside the Bayeux-Calvados Award for war correspondents, is part of a wider programme in the region’s middle schools that includes presentations and conversations with refugees and UNHCR representatives, a virtual reality tour of Za\\'atari refugee camp in Jordan (entitled “Clouds over Sidra”), cooking lessons and a UNHCR photo exhibition called “The Most Important Thing.”\\nThe initiative has been enthusiastically welcomed not only by the pupils but also by local politicians, education officials, teachers and, of course, the canteen staff.\\nAmong the refugee participants who told their stories to the schoolchildren were Suzanna Kiliani and her husband, Nabil Attar. The two of them fled Syria with their two boys in 2015. One of their sons is now the same age as the pupils at the collège.\\nSuzanna and Nabil believe it is important to talk to these French pupils about their experiences – why they had to flee, how they came to France and how they have embarked on their new lives.

In Syria, he worked as a banker but his first job in France was washing cars.\\n“And now today I am a chef because cooking is my passion and as I had to leave everything behind I decided to use my passion in my new life.”\\nSuch events and encounters create interest, curiosity and understanding among the pupils.\\n“I didn\\'t know they had to do so many things during their journey and cross so many countries to get to France,\" says Lea, a middle school pupil.\\nMargot adds: “It was really great – it makes us want to get to know refugees.”The musicians have just finished their first concert in the Kursaal concert hall as part of the Besançon Music Festival.\\nThe programme ended with the performance by Bangladeshi singer Azmari Nirjhar of the Afghan love song “Laili Jaan”, composed by the late singer Ahmad Zahir.

After spending years on the run, he found work and stability elusive, even in the country that welcomed him.\\n“It can be so difficult to find work when you first arrive,” says Puati, who eventually found employment at a hospital, cooking hundreds of dishes each day for patients. “But a job gives you a sense of autonomy and self-sufficiency.” Only recently did Puati’s employer realize he arrived as a refugee, seeing only a young man with intense work ethic and a sharp sense of humour.\\nIt is a scenario that is all too common. And Abdullah\\xa0Daoud wants to rectify it.\\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi met refugee Jean-Claude Puati (centre) and food services chef Jean-Marc Riverin, who hires refugees at Notre Dame Hospital in Montreal.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Michelle Siu\\nStanding behind a glowing screen in one of Montreal’s newest technology incubators, Daoud, the centre’s executive director, paces back and forth making his pitch – channelling the image of every tech maverick leading a high-profile product unveiling. “There’s a mountain of opportunity here. People just need to be guided towards it.”\\nIn the past two years, the Refugee Centre has taken aim at a range of issues: housing, employment and access to education. Supported by student tuition fees, the centre does not just advocate for policy initiatives to help the resettlement of refugees in Canada – it aims to draw deeply on technology, harnessing the potential of young refugees arriving in the city.\\n“More than 42,000 tech jobs were created in Montreal last year alone,” says Daoud. “We think we’ve pinpointed the future and we want refugees to be a part of that world.”\\n\"Learning a coding language is almost easier than a spoken language.\"\\nThe centre joins the ranks of technology incubators across the globe turning their attention to refugees and displaced people. Europe already has a number of tech-centred mentorship programs.\\nTouring Montreal on the first leg of a four-day Canada visit, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi met young refugees and students to learn first hand about the ways they are rethinking and innovating the refugee resettlement experience.\\nOrganizers at the centre see refugees as an untapped pool of potential in the tech world. Besides offering language classes in French and English, the centre also advertises an intensive boot camp to put those who have arrived recently through the paces of the tech world.\\n“Learning a coding language is almost easier than a spoken language,” says Daoud, whose parents were displaced from Palestine. “The big tech companies are more interested in the skills you’ve acquired, not your education level.” They have even modelled the space on a startup company. The walls are brightly painted, natural light pours in and art is scattered here and there to accent the open-plan work spaces.\\nWhile some of the applications produced by the centre are novel, for example a website for ordering custom hot sauces, much of the programming focuses on displacement. A pair of Syrian refugees are finalizing the development of a website to sell their desserts, a speciality in Aleppo, to the public and the centre is helping them add web functionality to allow for custom orders.\\nIn November, the centre will team up with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, IBM and Google for a ‘hack-a-thon’, a competition in which the public (and tech-savvy participants) are challenged rethink and redevelop a way of safely storing information necessary to make an asylum claim on arrival in Canada.\\n“Our skills are meaningless unless we share them with others.\"\\nAccompanied by Jean-Nicolas Beuze, UNHCR’s Canada representative, Grandi also had the opportunity to watch one of the centre’s newest innovations in action. Still in its testing phase, LUNA AI is a chat application that interacts with people making an asylum claim. Unlike the standard process, in which claimants frequently make mistakes on their applications, LUNA guides newcomers through a series of questions to ensure information is accurate. Many refugees fleeing conflict have access to smartphones, devices that have fundamentally changed the way people communicate and have access to information.\\n“It is great from every point of view,\" said Grandi after watching the demonstrations. \"From the point of view of innovation, from the point of view of technology, usability and accessibility. It is great because it is done by refugees themselves.”\\nNone\\n“Our skills are meaningless unless we share them with others,” says Daoud.© UNHCR 2001-2018He held him as tight as he could but waves loosened his grip.

A 2016 study by UNHCR,\\xa0the UN Refugee Agency,\\xa0found that 71 per cent of Syrian refugees in the country live below the poverty line, while 42 per cent of households live in dwellings that do not meet minimum humanitarian standards.\\n\"She had flooding, rats, cockroaches. She didn’t have proper drainage and electricity, so we felt like this was very critical to address, and we kind of started with her,” says\\xa0Aline Rad, an architect from Recycle Beirut. \"So our main focus was to create a safe environment for Haela and her children.\"\\nOver the past two years, Recycle Beirut, which employs vulnerable Syrian refugees like Haela in its recycling warehouse, has been working to help clean up the environment and solve the country’s waste crisis. Haela’s house is their first renovation project, which they describe as \"slum upgrading\".\\n“The first thing that we did was to create windows, let the sun in, put in some plants, and restore natural ventilation. Then we moved on to using recycled material for the renovation of the house,” adds\\xa0Rad.\\nMost of the concrete used to renovate Haela\\'s house was made up of sand, quarried stone, finely crushed green glass and construction waste. The NGO applied a non-toxic water sealer to the outside of the house and installed a secure energy efficient electrical system and new piping made of polypropylene. It also used eco-friendly paints for the living room. For the furniture, it used reclaimed wood and fabric from Tekaya Design, who offered their products for free.\\nThe renovation project, which also provided employment for more than 20 Lebanese and foreign people from plumbers to designers and tile makers, took six months to finish and cost the NGO US$10,000.\\n\\xa0“I am over the moon... I have a healthy house now.\"\\nHaela was delighted with the results, and says the renovation has had a positive impact on the lives of her children. “I am over the moon.

Her husband was killed when he returned to the village during the violence to find food while they hid in the forest.\\nMarie is one of over 600,000 displaced people who have returned to their homes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Kasai region this year, which has been affected by conflict since 2016.

Armed groups and the fires have destroyed any hope they had of returning home soon.\\n“All our belongings are there, we could not take them with us,” adds Rose. “If one day there will be peace, we’ll have no place to go back to.”\\n“They are setting all the houses on fire.\"\\nLike Rose, more than 60,000 refugees have crossed the Ubangi and Mboumou rivers in the past five months, fleeing the war-torn CAR for neighbouring DRC. Many are settling in remote river communities, with their home villages still in sight across the water but out of reach for those who do not want to risk their lives.\\nOn the Congolese side, some villages have grown to four times their original size due to the refugee arrivals and life is hard. “The children are dying, and we do not even know why,” says Philomene Gerekanda, traditional chief of the village of Lembo Rive in DRC in which refugees have set up huts next to the houses of locals. There is a lack of health services, not enough schools and not enough drinking water.\\nCentral African refugees, exiled across the river, long for home\\xa0(Vania Turner, producer-editor / Walter Kigali, camera)\\nUNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, continues to register new arrivals and has provided essential relief items like plastic sheeting, buckets and sleeping mats to refugees. The agency is also drilling wells to reduce water-borne diseases, since many people drink the water from Ubangi River.\\nBut despite over 500,000 CAR refugees spread across the region, the crisis remains the most underfunded in the world. In 2017, UNHCR and partners appealed for US$209 million. To date, only 9 per cent of those funds have been received, making it a challenge to help CAR refugees who have been displaced for years, as well those continuing to flee.\\nThose who dare to return home can pay a heavy price. Virginie Anyezou was so desperate to find food for her hungry children that she and her 15-year-old son took a boat home across the river. Now she is lying on a bamboo bed in a small village on the Congolese shore of the Ubangi River, motionless and speaking in a low voice.\\n“I needed something to cook for the children, so I told my oldest son to come with me,” she recalls. “We wanted to harvest the manioc from our field.”\\n“When we came near, my son said to me: ‘Wait, I can hear the voices of the armed men. So we went a bit further. But they had seen us and were waiting for us. They shot at us and the boat turned over. We cried for help, but nobody came.”\\nVirginie and her son were finally rescued by fishermen, but she was shot in the thigh and a bullet penetrated her son’s hand. The same day their neighbour, father-of-five Michel Baleto, 40, was killed when he tried to get food from his fields in CAR.\\n\"We cried for help, but nobody came.\"\\nMany villages on the banks of the CAR are now deserted. A priest who recently crossed reports that armed groups require civilians to wear a ribbon to show their allegiance – yellow for one side, red for the other. “There is no neutrality anymore,” he says. “They force everybody to take sides.”\\nThere are reports of armed groups forcing people to return. \"In some locations, refugees tell us that they receive a message from the fighters on the other side: ‘We have conquered your village. Either you return or we will set your house on fire’,” says Pierre Richard Muhima of UNHCR in DRC.\\nMeanwhile, thousands continue to flee over the border. “We were the last ones in the village,” says Francois Koko, a 42-year-old fisherman who is happy that he, his wife and their three children aged one, two and five are safe. “It was three in the morning when we heard gunfire all around. I did not know which one of the groups it was. We got up and ran. We took nothing, we just grabbed the mosquito nets and the bed sheets.”\\nIn the early hours, the family reached their fishing boat, a dug-out canoe.\\n“When we were in the canoe, the children panicked with all the gunfire nearby. We had to hold them, so that they did not fall into the river.”\\nStanding knee-deep in the water next to his fishing boat, he gazes across the river.\\n“There is nobody left over there to teach, there are no schools anymore,” he says. “And all the nurses have fled to the capital, Bangui.”\\nHis village is less than a thousand metres away but, for now, it is out of reach.Knowing soldiers could soon come and take away her two eldest sons, Milly and her children fled the village of Opari, South Sudan, in December 2013, with the screams of neighbours and sounds of gunfire still ringing in their ears.\\n“I thought they would either abduct them or, if I resisted, kill them,” she recalls. To her horror, she became separated from them\\xa0as they left.\\nMilly, 47, who gave a moving speech at the Executive Committee meeting of the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, in Geneva meeting last week (Oct 2-6) on the urgent need for an end to the conflict in South Sudan, found herself leading a group of 30 women and children away from the violence, towards the Ugandan border.\\nTogether, they\\xa0trekked for days. At every turn, Milly – a mother of six – prayed for the safety of her two eldest boys. “On the fourth day, in the evening, I found them. They arrived with swollen legs, having walked and ran everywhere. I cried because I did not imagine that I would see them alive again.”\\n\"I cried because I did not imagine that I would see them alive again.”\\nFinally, with their group growing ever larger, Milly and her children crossed the border into Uganda, where the driver of a garbage truck offered to take them to Kiriandongu reception centre in the west. By then, they were so hungry and desperate to rest, they had little choice. “It was filthy, but what can one do?” says Milly.\\nIn Kiriandongu, Milly and her children were registered as refugees and given a plot of land to farm and live on. Even now, their worries are far from over. When it rains, their hut leaks and mud seeps through the cracks. Her two eldest children cannot attend school, because Milly cannot afford the fees of 300,000 UGX (about US$80) per term. Just making sure her young children have enough to eat is a daily struggle.\\n“Life is not easy, it’s hard,” she says, with tears in her eyes. “Because the number of refugees has increased drastically, food rations and land have been halved. But all of them are refugees and human beings, so they must also eat. They did not come because they wanted to, they fled war the same way we did.”\\nTo add to her heartache, in 2014, a friend broke the painful news that her husband, a military man who was conscripted,\\xa0had been shot in fighting between rival forces.\\xa0\\n“Enough is enough.\"\\n\\xa0\\nArnauld Akodjenou, UNHCR\\'s Regional Refugee Coordinator for the South Sudan Situation and Special Adviser to the High Commissioner, called for safety and dignity for millions like Milly in a Facebook Live discussion yesterday. “Enough is enough,” he said. “First, for the population inside South Sudan. Enough is enough for those who fled and became refugees. And enough is enough for those in six host countries who have received refugees from South Sudan and are not receiving international support.”\\nFighting in South Sudan has cost thousands of lives and driven four million people from their homes. There are more than one million South Sudanese refugees in Uganda alone and over 85 per cent of those are women and children. However, UNHCR has received just 21 per cent of the US$674 million needed to support them for 2017.\\n“We must focus on conflict prevention and make sure that all ways and means have been put in place to have an inclusive dialogue, which is critical in South Sudan today,” said Akodjenou. “It should not become a forgotten crisis.”\\nMilly is so determined to improve the lives of women and children from South Sudan\\xa0that, as president of the child protection committee and women’s affairs representative, she travels from village to village counselling women and children suffering from depression and trauma. She also attends inter-agency meetings.\\n“Women and children are suffering, and I think they will continue to suffer without the help of the international community,” she says. “The status of being a refugee is not permanent. At some point we shall go back home. They have to remain themselves because they are the future of our country.”\\nMilly hopes that, one day, she and her family will return home.\\n“My only dream is if peace could return to South Sudan and we could go back home. You know, there is no place like home.”None\\nNone\\nNone\\nWhy did you become an aid worker?\\nI saw an advertisement in a newspaper for a driver with UNHCR. I decided to apply because I wanted to help people who are in need and suffering, and make them feel at home. I got the job and had to leave my family in Kampala to come back to my home town of Arua to work. But I feel good. I am a strong woman and I do my job with passion.\\nMost rewarding/challenging thing about your job? \\nI spent more than five years with as a driver for commercial trucking companies in Kampala before I joined UNHCR. I am the only female driver here and I have people who encourage me, and I have others who try to discourage me and tease me. But I tell them not to tease me, that we are here to help people and that we must all join together to do our job.\\nI drive UNHCR staff in different sectors, at different times depending my assignment. These include, for example, site planners when they go out to open up roads for new settlements. Or the protection team when it goes to help newly arrived refugees to settle in. I also drive visitors, such as donors and journalists, to the settlements.\\nAmong the hazards I encounter are potholes, bad drivers, wildlife and livestock – mostly cows, goats and pigs. Driving 150 kilometres of potholed roads is challenging. The roads get muddy and very slippery during the rainy season. Bridges get washed away and roads are cut off, making it necessary to take longer routes.\\nVicky Munguriek: Why I became an aid worker\\nWhen I come across animals while driving, I apply the ‘safety first’ rule by slowing down and allowing them to cross before I proceed, to keep my passengers, the animals and myself safe. Using the defensive driving rule enables me to anticipate the actions of bad drivers and give them way to avoid to accidents.\\nI feel satisfied when I have helped a refugee to get what they need. Even though that is not part of my job I feel very emotional about it.\\nWhat was the best day that you had at work? \\nA few weeks ago, I saw two girls crossing the border from South Sudan who were very young, they were teenagers, who were travelling in a group and had left their parents behind. They were dirty and hungry and waiting to be registered. There was a delay and they started to cry. So I went to a registration desk and begged them to register the girls and told them I couldn’t leave until they passed through.\\nThey registered and managed to get food at the collection point and I was happy. A week ago I was at the Imvepi settlement in the north, and the two girls saw me and came over to say hello and give me a hug. They are now settled and have a plot of land. I was so impressed. They have gained weight. And they have shelter and are going to school. They have their basic needs and are in safe hands, even though their parents are not with them.\\nWhat was your worst day at work? \\nOne day driving back from the Rhino settlement a vehicle overtook me on the road and knocked over and killed a four-year old girl. She was a member of the local community. It was the most terrifying day in my work experience.\\nWhat is also painful is that I don’t have a voice. There are two leaders in South Sudan – the rebel leader and the President – and I don’t understand how they are letting people suffer. Let the United Nations solve the issue so the suffering can stop – it’s the question I ask myself every day. I would like to see the issue settled at a round table.For the past two years, the 13-year-old Syrian boy has been using a wheelchair. Coming to terms with his injury and life in exile had exhausted his confidence in the future.\\nNow, however, as a refugee in Greece, Najib has made a discovery that is helping him to imagine himself in a new light – as a Paralympic athlete.\\nTwo years ago, a bomb attack on his home in the city of Homs left the slight, wisp of a boy paralysed from the waist down. In spite his injury, Najib and his family made their escape from the fighting all around them, and braved a Mediterranean Sea crossing\\xa0on rubber dinghy from Turkey\\xa0to Greece. They were\\xa0eventually\\xa0granted asylum there\\xa0in 2016.\\nLast November\\xa0Najib signed up for\\xa0a pilot\\xa0Paralympic education project\\xa0managed\\xa0by the Hellenic Paralympic Committee, the Agitos Foundation and UNHCR. The project\\xa0is helping\\xa0to\\xa0empower\\xa0refugees with disabilities – particularly the young – by giving them the\\xa0chance to learn sports train and even compete at the national Paralympic level. For Najib, the experience has been transformative, giving him a reason to strive. Moreover, it has given the boy, now only 13, the means to once again have something to look forward to in the future.Before leaving Nyanza reception centre in southern Rwanda a day earlier, Charlene had gathered firewood and other supplies for their new home. “We only brought a few clothes with us,” she says. “You couldn’t take anything much with you.”\\nViolence broke out back in Burundi in 2015 after President Pierre Nkurunziza announced he would seek a third term in office. The constant threats and inability to meet militias\\' demands for money forced the family to escape one cold night in June this year.\\nNow, Charlene and her family are among over 400,000 Burundians who have become displaced across the region in Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since the crisis started in 2015.\\n“We only brought a few clothes with us.\"\\nNone\\n“The chronic underfunding for the Burundi refugee situation has severely hampered reception capacities and the quality of protection rendered by host countries,” said Catherine Wiesner, UNHCR’s Regional Refugee Coordinator for Burundi, at the launch of the revised inter-agency regional refugee response plan in Nairobi, Kenya.\\nRefugees continue to live in overcrowded and congested camps, facing insecurity, deterioration of emergency shelters, shortages of water and food, and oversubscribed health and education services. “Many refugee hosting areas are at risk of communicable diseases, including, malaria and acute watery diarrhoea,” added Wiesner.\\nIn Mahama, the impact of the huge gap in funding is evident as UNHCR and aid agencies struggle to meet minimum standards for refugees.\\n“Funding is a major challenge in terms of being able to construct shelters and respond to all the needs of Burundian refugees,” says Janet Pima, UNHCR’s Protection Officer in Mahama. “Because we keep on receiving new arrivals that means the needs are increasing every day.”\\nIn Rwanda, more than 85,000 refugees live in cities such as Kigali and in Mahama. For a country as small as Rwanda, such numbers place a huge strain on resources and Mahama camp is already at breaking point.\\n“We have around 54,000 refugees in the camp and the space we have has already been occupied by semi-permanent shelters,” adds Pima. “We don’t have any more space which is the main challenge we have for now. We will not be able to relocate any new arrivals until we have an extension of the camp.”\\n“We don’t have any more space.\"\\nNew arrivals have to wait for weeks, sometimes months, before they can be relocated.\\nUNHCR is negotiating with the Rwandan government and local communities that own the land around the camp. However, with every refugee that enters the \\xa0country, more pressure is added to already strained resources.\\nIn Tanzania, where the majority of Burundian refugees are hosted, small numbers of refugees have already undertaken to return home spontaneously. A tripartite meeting was concluded between UNHCR and the governments of Burundi and Tanzania at the end of August 2017. Since then, plans have been put in place to assist an estimated 12,000 Burundian refugees to return home in the last quarter of the year.\\nBuregeya Leonidas left his home in Burundi’s south eastern province of Rutana in October 2015 for Nduta camp in Tanzania with his wife and seven children.\\n“I have strongly desired to return home since April 2017 and I have waited until this day to fulfil my dreams,” says the 40-year-old farmer.\\nA tripartite meeting that was concluded between UNHCR and the governments of Burundi and Tanzania at the end of August 2017 paved the way for refugees like Buregeya to return home. Since then, plans have been put in place to assist an estimated 12,000 Burundian refugees to return home in the last quarter of 2017.\\nBuregaya returned home with two cherished items - a solar panel and a radio he bought with his savings while in Tanzania. He is ready to resume farming and will use the cash grant he received as seed money to start a small business.\\nHowever, unlike him, the majority of Burundian refugees like Charlene and her family are not yet planning to return. For now, the relocation to Mahama is welcome and offers the chance to start afresh. The family has been registered, allocated a shelter, food and other supplies \\xa0giving them hope that they will be able to resume a normal life. “I think we will get used to things here as we can see things are okay,” says Charlene.\\nUNHCR continues to work with the government and partner agencies to receive and care for new arrivals despite the challenges, but the need for more support is crucial.\\n“If we don’t get the space soon, refugees will be congested in the shelters or they will have to remain in the reception centres for quite a long time,” says Pima. “We are appealing for more funding to help Burundian refugees.”Instead, it almost ruined her life.\\nInsurgents from Boko Haram, who have brought turmoil to much of north-east Nigeria in recent years, had blocked the road between two villages. Her husband, Usman, a primary school teacher was pulled out of the car.\\n“They asked him for ID, but he did not have it… they just shot him dead. They took the car and drove off, leaving me and two wives of other brothers on the side of the road,” she said.\\n“It was baking hot, and we thought we might die.”\\nHamzatu was four months pregnant. “It was baking hot, and we thought we might die. We were there for two hours with no water before a man on a motorcycle came by. He sped off to the next village and told them what had happened and they came and got us.”\\nThat was four years ago. “June 6, 2013,” she said, recalling the day her life changed forever in an instant.\\nAlive, but now widowed with four children, soon to be five, Hamzatu had faced a bleak future. With little formal education and limited access to funds, widows in Nigeria can face extremely challenging situations if the main breadwinner is suddenly removed. Finding a lifeline can be all but impossible.\\nHamzatu’s deceased husband’s relatives rallied around, but with their own families to take care of, there were limits to the support they could offer.\\n“Usman’s elder brother took care of me until I gave birth, but then he moved to Kano (capital of a neighbouring state), and we lost contact,” she recounted. “He moved ahead with his own life.”\\nHamzatu at the entrance of her home in Maiduguri.\\r\\n\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Rahima Gambo\\nIn time, Hamzatu made her way to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, where she had other relatives. Life was tough, but because her husband had been a state employee she initially received a small state pension. That dried up after six months.\\n“It is all about lifelines – finding hope again.”\\nNone\\n“It was enough to find a place to live, and get started again,” she explained.\\nIn an interview with UNHCR, Mustapha explained the motives behind the organization. “It is all about lifelines, that is what we aim to do – help people get a living again. Once they have that, they have hope again.”\\nHamzata’s 10-year-old son, Aliyu Usman, was accepted at Mustapha’s primary school, which takes diplaced orphans and vulnerable children created by the insurgency that began in the early 2000s but exploded into major violence in 2009. Some 2.3 million people have been displaced and more than 20,000 killed.\\nThanks to the cooperative, Hamzatu also managed to apply for a grant from the ICRC which she used to set up a small vegetable juice business. She also makes the traditional hats worn by men in northern Nigeria.\\n“Life is so much better. Life is still tough but I am hoping now to be able to save and in time afford my own shop where I can sell the products I make… Mustapha has helped is all so much, he is so good,” she said.\\nMustapha will receive the award at a special ceremony in Geneva on Monday, October 2.In 2013, he and his family fled to Jordan and ended up in the remote refugee camp of Azraq. There, Qusai’s hopes of continuing his education seemed to evaporate.\\nDesperate to keep on learning, he signed up for every informal class he could find -- English, computing, even mobile phone repair. Unable to afford the fees or secure a visa to study in a third country, the idea of finishing his degree remained out of reach.\\nThat was when he heard about an initiative called InZone, backed by the University of Geneva and offering a degree-level history course devised by Princeton University in the United States.\\n“There were prestigious institutions involved and I really wanted to take it.”\\n“I hadn’t thought about studying history before but there were prestigious institutions involved and I really wanted to take it,” Qusai said.\\nEnrolment in tertiary, or third-stage, education has been rising worldwide -- 36 per cent in 2016, compared with 34 per cent a year earlier – but for 99 per cent of refugees, access to university and other forms of tertiary education remains out of reach.\\nThe demand is clearly there: in 2016, more than 4,300 refugees received DAFI scholarships, the higher education programme provided by the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR and supported by Germany, to seek tertiary education in 37 host countries, an increase of almost 90 per cent compared with 2015. However, for tens of thousands more, fees, distance and the difficulty of completing secondary education conspired to shut them out.\\nInZone shows how higher education can be available to those who may not normally have access to it. First established in Kenya’s Kakuma refugee camp in 2010, the initiative reached Azraq in September 2016 with the Princeton history course.\\nNow an engineering course provided by another US institution, Purdue University, is also available. Classroom sessions are held in a computer lab funded by UNHCR and run by the non-governmental organization CARE International.\\n“Being connected to the outside world of academia makes you feel part of something bigger.”\\nJames Casey, a doctoral candidate in modern Syrian history at Princeton, was one of the online tutors for the Azraq course. He says that, unlike normal online or correspondence courses where retention rates are often low, the InZone approach is to promote regular engagement between tutors and students, whether online, face-to-face or via social media. That is how to keep them “engaged and on track”, he said.\\nCourse tutors and professors try to visit students in the camp at the start and end of term, in the first case to hold selection exams and introduce those selected to the course, and later to oversee an end-of-course workshop and final exams.\\nBesides the computer lab, students use mobile devices to study and can have access to material on USB flash drives when the Internet is unavailable. Tutor groups are set up on the WhatsApp instant messaging service to enable communication between students and teachers even when connectivity is limited.\\nThe course kept Qusai intellectually stimulated and gave him hope. “Studying with top universities and being connected to the outside world of academia makes you feel part of something bigger -- not just a number in a refugee camp,” he said.\\nIt also opened fresh perspectives. “We learned about how the countries of Europe rebuilt after World War Two, and that gave me hope that we can do the same in Syria.”\\nNoneLera smiled despite the fact that she had woken up early to take a crowded bus to get to a school in Velyka Verhunka, a suburb of Luhansk, because the school in her village of Krasny Yar had been destroyed by shelling back in 2014.\\nThe conflict in Ukraine has cost more than 10,000 lives and damaged at least 700 schools, including 55 since the beginning of 2017. Frequent\\xa0exchanges of fire in areas near the line of contact continue to damage civilian infrastructure, and safety and security remain major concerns for nearly 800,000 people living in the country’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\\n\"I see some questions in their eyes. I see they are worrying.\"\\nOn her first day at the newly reconstructed school, Lera proudly wore a big white bow on her head – a common local tradition – and a blue UNICEF rucksack on her back with essential stationery, delivered by UNHCR. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTeacher Antonina Strelets gave the first graders sheets of paper with sketches of white doves drawn on them.\\n“Kids, what is the most important thing in life?” she asked her class, as they began to color the sketches. “Peace,” they replied in unison. Someone added: “And love.”\\nStrelets, 53, said it was hard for her to be at the grand opening of the school year because it brought back memories of summer 2014, when her mother had been killed by shells that landed on her house.\\nNow the teacher notices that schoolchildren often have sad eyes. “I see that they are anxious and tense,” she said. “I see some questions in their eyes. I see they are worrying – they get these worries from their parents.”\\nShe has also seen the conflict make many families significantly poorer, with children often experiencing a shortage of food and basic items such as clothes, books and toys. Many also miss their parents who must travel to make their living.\\nLera’s mother has been disabled since childhood and the family live very modestly, without a father. They survive thanks to her grandmother who has worked as a concierge in Moscow for the last 15 years and earns around USD$245 per month.\\nWith little money to prepare Lera and her sister Dasha, 13, for school, the family were delighted when Oleksandr Bakshy, the UNHCR shelter associate in Luhansk, brought a box of personal hygiene products, donated by the International Organization for\\xa0Migration (IOM), the day before the school started.\\n“I ran to the school and saw our caretaker crying at the entrance.\"\\nBakshy also promised that his team would install a new door on their house after the previous one was destroyed by shelling.\\nSince opening its office in Luhansk in autumn 2015, the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, has become a major supplier of UN assistance in this area. Its staff have delivered shelter repair materials to more than 1,500 families, rehabilitated 88 houses and, in 2017 alone, helped to repair 89 schools.\\nLera’s school in Velyka Verhunka is one of them. Back in August 2014, a mortar shell fell in the playground, smashing windows and starting a fire.\\n“I ran to the school and saw our caretaker crying at the entrance, saying: ‘Our school is burning’,” the school principal Olga Sergeyeva said. She said 13 civilians had been killed in the town, but fortunately all of the children survived.\\n\"It’s always loud in our school so we don’t hear the sounds of shelling.\"\\nNow the hole from the shell is covered with grass, but the school walls and iron gymnastic bars are still pierced by shrapnel. A colorful bear, bunny and cat made from old car tires brighten up the playground and distract children from the conflict. It is never far away – the children know that a forest plantation behind their playground is a mined area and are told never to approach the Siversky Donets river, which is now a frontline.\\xa0The presence of unexploded ordinance around civilian areas threatens local populations and affects livelihoods.\\xa0\\nPrincipal Sergeyeva, 57, who has worked at the school since the early 1980s, said that children are often afraid of thunder and do not like fireworks. But the teachers try to involve them in various activities to help them forget about the ongoing conflict.\\n“It’s good that it’s always loud in our school so we don’t hear the sounds of shelling here,” Sergeyeva said.\\nWith the conflict in Ukraine now in its fourth year, UNHCR continues to call on all parties involved to ensure protection of civilians and civilian areas from the consequences of fighting and shelling.“Since I moved to Tilos I have been calling it the land of dreams or ‘Dreamland’,” says Kusai Al-Damad, who fled Syria and now works in a bakery on the picturesque island. \"It is a society where we all live together peacefully.”\\nUNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and its partner Solidarity Now, with European Commission funding support, have been providing accommodation and language classes to adults and children for almost a year. Many of the refugees – all of whom have been granted refugee status and have the right to work – say they want to stay, and for the islanders it has become an honour to host them.\\n“In order to integrate and have normal lives, [the refugees] need to work. And of course, it’s a great honour for us that these people want to stay here,\" says Mayor Maria Kamma. \"Is there anything more precious than human love?\"Even though early in the day, a baking hot sun is creating beads of sweat on the brows of excited students lined up in front of a modest wooden stage. Music blasts out of speakers to one side. The school has limited resources, but big ambitions.

She has just been named as the school’s new head girl following a rigorous selection process. Five years ago, however, she almost had to abandon school.\\n“I thought my schooling days were over for good. I lost hope.”\\n“My father was a soldier, so was my brother… both were killed by Boko Haram,” she told UNHCR, explaining her mother then had to support her and the rest of her family by selling charcoal and firewood. “I thought my schooling days were over for good.

One of her best friends, Zeinab Ibrahim, who was also an orphan at Mustapha’s school, also came to the secondary and has just been named a head prefect.\\n“This is a good day, a happy day – but we owe everything to Mr. Mustapha and we will always see him as our father. He treated us all the same. He is such a good man.”“Things have really changed here since Mr Luka joined us,” says Dario, a maths teacher at Unity. “The students come to school on time and they pay more attention during assembly and in class.”\\nUnity is one of the largest schools in Kakuma refugee camp, in northern Kenya, and the scale of the challenge facing its teachers is difficult to comprehend. Classes of 90 or 100 are common and classes of 200 are not unusual. In such circumstances, engaging and inspiring the students is a daunting task. Staying motivated as a teacher can also be tough.\\nAt Kakuma, help has arrived from a long way off. More than 70 percent of the teachers there have participated in a project called Teachers for Teachers – a training, coaching and mentoring system devised by Columbia University in the United States.\\n“Coaching has really helped me become a better leader.”\\nTraining begins face-to-face with international and local instructors. Groups of 25 to 30 teachers learn techniques and methods appropriate to working in challenging environments such as those in Kakuma’s classrooms. After that, the programme continues with more coaching, plus support from “global mentors” – volunteer teachers from around the world who provide regular, real-time support via mobile apps such as the WhatsApp messaging system.\\nParticipants follow two “tracks” concurrently – a shorter programme and an extended, more in-depth course. Both contain modules on the role of the teacher, child protection and inclusion, teaching methods, and curriculum and planning. Those who complete the programmes can choose to become coaches themselves.\\nFor Luka, this has been the most inspiring part of the Teachers for Teachers system. As a peer coach, he has become a reliable source of support for 50 of his colleagues throughout the refugee camp. “Coaching has really helped me become a better leader,” he says.\\nAcross the road from Unity is Mogadishu Primary, another school given a shot in the arm by Teachers for Teachers. Salome Perpetua, 32, a science teacher, is also a peer coach and mentors 40 colleagues in five schools. “This training has really changed my life,” she says. “It has empowered me to share my skills with my colleagues, because not all of them were able to be trained.\\n“I can discuss challenges online with the mentors and get a solution very quickly.”\\n“The training has changed how things work around here.”\\nMary Mendenhall, an assistant professor of practice at Columbia’s Teachers College, started Teachers for Teachers with funding from Open IDEO, an innovation platform. UNHCR supported her and her team to pilot it at Kakuma in 2015. Since then, 130 teachers have gone through the programme.\\n“These teachers are really on the front line every day and they can speak to the issues and help one another think through how they can overcome some of the challenges,” says Mendenhall.\\nLuka’s experience with the programme has inspired him to enroll for a degree in education, but he believes the impacts have gone beyond teachers’ professional development. “The training has changed how things work around here,” he says.\\n“Our students are more determined to succeed because they can see that their teachers are so motivated to support them achieve their goals.”\\nNoneNervously playing with her fingers, she recounted in a quiet voice how armed gunmen from Boko Haram had stormed one morning into their small home in a village near Damboa, north-east Nigeria and shot him dead.\\n“He was doing his ablutions before praying, but they just came in and shot him dead in his room,” she said softly.\\nTragedy then struck again a few weeks later. Her father’s elder brother, her uncle, came to the village to take them to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state where the Boko Haram insurgency has driven hundreds of thousands from their homes and killed at least 20,000.\\n\"Dreams of becoming a doctor were in tatters.\"\\n“He thought we would be safer there because Boko Haram fighters were taking over the area around the village, but on the way my mother who was pregnant died in childbirth,” Hauwa added.\\nHauwa moved in with her aunt and uncle who have six of their own children, some of whom resented the presence of the newcomer. At the young age of 10, she was facing a life with no education and little hope. Her dreams of becoming a doctor were in tatters.\\nNone\\n“When I think about my parents I become sad, I miss them,” Hauwa recounted. “But I love this school and studying. I have two really good friends… Mr. Mustapha is a really good man. He takes care of all us here. He gives us food, books and free study. I still want to study medicine and I think I have a chance.”\\nPupils at Mustupha’s two schools, known as Future Prowess One and Two, also receive at least one meal a day as many of the children arrive at school hungry.\\n“This school is really like my home now. I can think of tomorrow again because of what he has done for us here,” added Hauwa.\\nThe school’s pupils come from all sides of the conflict. Children of suspected Boko Haram militants learn alongside those of members of the security services, Muslims alongside Christians.\\n“There is no way a child will learn with an empty stomach.”\\n“Every person here needs a lifeline, a fresh chance in life… In one way or another everyone here is a victim of this terrible insurgency,” Mustapha said in an interview with UNHCR, explaining his thinking behind the school and an accompanying project for widows which he set up through his Future Prowess Islamic Foundation in 2007.\\n“There is no way a child will learn with an empty stomach,” Mustapha said. “We have to provide everything including uniforms, but thanks to our many supporters we have been able to do this.”\\nNone\\n“I am really hoping this award can take us to another stage and help us set up scholarships for further education… Many of the pupils from the early years are now ready to go to college or university and we must find a way to finance that,” he said.The Germans are still rather bemused by this game that fires up the Afghans and gives them a sense of home. But thanks in part to the contribution of refugees, Germany is emerging as a cricketing nation.\\n“I’m passionate about cricket,” says Masih Shams, 19, originally from Kabul. “When I came to Germany, I thought I would never play again. But a boy in school told me there were clubs and I joined up. When I tell my teachers or fellow students, they say: ‘Really, is there cricket in Germany?’”\\nAlmost as surprising is the fact that the SG Findorff club was started by a woman. Nisar Tahir, 47, a Pakistani who grew up in Germany, founded the club four years ago because she and her family missed cricket. When refugees began arriving in Bremen in 2015, she visited reception sites to help them and to spot talent.\\n“When I came to Germany, I thought I would never play again.\"\\nThe club has already been a success – last year Bremen were the all-German cricket champions. They are in the semi-finals again this year.

But the Taliban didn’t like cricket, only war.”\\nNow the youngest player in SG Findorff, Farooq is enjoying his life in Bremen, where he has picked up German and made friends.\\n“I brought my class to see the cricket ground and did a presentation,” he says. “I told them cricket is a complicated game and three things are important – fielding, bowling and batting.”\\nCricket is relatively new to Germany, where 27 million people belong to sports clubs of different kinds. Not only does cricket help refugees to feel at home in Germany but the game could also attract Germans, adding variety and the possibility of new friendships to their sporting lives.\\nNone\\n\"The Taliban didn’t like cricket, only war.”\\n“Here, I came to realize I am a good spin bowler,” says Ghulam Haidar Haideri, 19, from Kandahar, Afghanistan, who plans a career in IT.\\xa0“Last week, I took five wickets in the Bremen versus Hamburg one-day match.”\\nMasih does everything from batting to wicket-keeping. “If I was playing at such a high level in Afghanistan, I would probably consider a career, but here it can be no more than a hobby.

He was concerned by the growing numbers of children on the streets of the capital of Borno state, Maiduguri – the heart of an insurgency which has killed an estimated 20,000 people and displaced some 2.3 million others.\\n\"If they have no education what will happen to them.\"\\nHe feared growing insecurity and the ensuing military crackdown was producing a generation of children with no education and that this would in turn create even more problems for one of the poorest regions of the country.\\n“There were children everywhere, on the streets all alone… If they have no education what will happen to them… I kept wondering what would happen to my daughter if I died, who would pay for her education? I realized I had to act,” he added.\\n“When I was a young man growing up you did not see this sort of thing. The family looked after orphans, but this has become more and more difficult.”\\nWith the help and support of a small group of friends with whom he regularly used to play table tennis, his favourite hobby, he decided to create the Future Prowess Islamic Foundation to house a school and other charitable bodies to help the victims of all sides of the insurgency.\\nPointing at a tree-covered corner of his large 6,000 square-metre compound – the fruit of a successful property deal – he said: “That is where we used to play ping-pong, but I decided I did not need that much space. I replaced the tables with a small building for… children.”\\nFrom the seed of that building today has grown a school with 540 pupils, of whom 282 are girls. There is a waiting list of another 2,000. In the headmaster’s office, piles of applications are stacked together in one corner.\\n“We simply cannot keep up with demand,” says Suleiman Aliyu, who has been at the school since its creation.\\n“This place is protected because all sides of the conflict are represented here and we teach Islamic and so-called Western education. We teach Arabic, French, English, Maths – this is all Mustapha’s achievement. A child is a child to him whatever its background.”\\nIn keeping with Mustapha’s deep belief in inclusivity, those at the school come from both Christian and Muslim families and from both sides of the conflict. They pay no fees, the main barrier to thousands of poor Nigerians receiving basic education.\\n“Those affected by the insurgency must be given a lifeline to carry on, they must be encouraged in life,” he said animatedly over a lunch of roasted meat, spices and bread. Dressed in a traditional dark blue robe, he spoke of the importance of providing “lifelines” so people displaced by the conflict can lead self-sustaining lives.\\nIn addition to school, his foundation has created an association for widows and given land to other displaced people to farm.\\nMany of the children at the school are orphans, but they are mixed in with the children of teachers, security guards, and some of the younger children of Mustapha himself. Some had parents who were with Boko Haram, others in the security forces that fought them.\\n“Here, we are all one… and that is what matters,” Mustapha said. “The message I want to send is that we are caught in an inseparable net of mutuality. As humanity we are bounded by one nation, so we need to be our brother’s keeper… We have to be one – and not only be one but seen to be one.”\\n\"This man has changed the life of so many people here.\"\\nSuch is demand that Mustapha’s Foundation has now set up a second school, situated on the banks of River Gadabul. This school currently has 88 pupils, but will in time be much larger and have its own sleeping quarters.\\nNear the school, Mustapha had made available some 16 hectares of land, which is farmed by displaced people living in nearby shelters, provided by UNHCR and its partners.\\n“This man has changed the life of so many people here. He has provided free farmland, free education, he even gave us seeds at the start and planted his own crop to show us what could be done,” said Sharif Abubakar, who fled his home after it was overrun by Boko Haram two years ago and is now the head of the foundation’s farm project.\\nMustapha’s philanthropy has won many admirers. Unlike senior politicians, he has no enemies and links to all sides of the conflict. This led to him becoming one of the chief mediators in efforts to obtain the release of the Chibok schoolgirls who gained worldwide attention when they were abducted by Boko Haram militants in April 2014.\\nAltogether 276 girls were kidnapped. In the confusion immediately after the kidnapping, 57 managed to escape, but the rest were driven far into the Sambisa forest.\\nMustapha made contact with the abductors and, after a series of confidence-building measures, he was able to negotiate the release of 21 girls. Last May he had a major breakthrough, when another 82 girls were set free.\\n“They were brought to a pre-arranged place not far from the border with Cameroon and one by one they came forward and identified themselves… As they realized what was happening they were very excited and happy,” he recalled with a broad smile. “I am sure more will come out soon.”As the bell rings for the start of the day at Paysannat L School, just outside Mahama refugee camp, she is at her desk ready to begin.\\nAfter civil unrest erupted in Burundi in 2015 over disputed elections, Lydiella, her mother and her three sisters joined refugees streaming into neighbouring Rwanda. Today there are more than 50,000 in Mahama, a camp close to the Burundian border.\\nKeen to regain some stability in her life, Lydiella, 13, looked forward to resuming her education. However, in Rwanda classes are taught in English, not French as in Burundi.\\nUNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and the Rwandan Government devised a solution. Together, they set up a system that enables refugee children to plug into Rwanda’s national curriculum.\\n“It was the first time I had heard about the sciences and social studies.”\\nThis was in the form of a comprehensive, six-month bridging course, known as the orientation project, which includes English lessons. It is one of many such initiatives supported by UNHCR around the world to boost refugees’ education and help them move into a formal learning environment.\\nRefugees who largely missed out on an education at home follow the entire course. Others are enrolled in state schools at a suitable level as soon as they are ready. At the 2016 UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants, Rwanda pledged to help include Burundian refugees in its national education system. It is striving to meet that promise.\\nThe Paysannat L School prepares refugee children from Burundi for integration into the Rwandan education system. \\nThe bridging course introduced Lydiella to more than another language. It is designed to educate students in other subjects, too. “It was the first time I had heard about the sciences and social studies,” she says. “Orientation is a way of getting used to what other students study here, especially if you are a newcomer.”\\nCharles Munyaneza, UNHCR’s associate education officer based in Kigali, says: “We realized we needed to integrate refugee students into the national system as they faced serious barriers to coping and adapting.”\\n“It is a really crucial step towards including refugees in the national education system.”\\nThe bridging project started at Mahama in June 2015 with 2,500 students. Since then, more than 19,000 children have passed through. “It is a really crucial step towards including refugees in the national education system,” says Munyaneza.\\nPaysannat L is one of several schools in the area with the Paysannat name – with a total student population of almost 20,000 – but it is the only one where refugees and local students learn side-by-side. Jean-Claude Muhyemama, the deputy head, says having a common language has played an important role in integrating the two communities and promoting good relations.\\n“This project has really helped the Burundian students get to the same level as Rwandan students,” he says. “At the beginning, they knew very little or no English but now they can express themselves well.”\\nHaving adapted to the Rwandan curriculum and reached the last year of primary school, Lydiella enjoys her studies hugely. She hopes one day to spread her love of English to her fellow Burundians. “If one day I return to Burundi, I will teach others English because it is important,” she says. “It is spoken around the whole world and so I think if people learn it, it will help them in their life.”\\nJean Harindwa, Lydiella’s English teacher, has been working at the school since it opened in 2015. Himself a Burundian, he says teaching English has helped him with his own mastery of the language. “It was a good thing to start this project,” he says.\\n“Most of these students fled their country and they didn’t think they would ever learn again.”\\nNoneFirst, there is the language. In Lebanon, the curriculum is taught in French and English, while students in Syria learn in Arabic.\\nSecond, many Syrian refugee families live in overcrowded and often basic conditions. In Lebanon, more than 1 million Syrian refugees are scattered throughout more than 2,100 urban and rural communities, many living in substandard shelters. For a young person trying to concentrate on their homework, peace and quiet are scarce commodities.\\nFor those lucky enough to encounter volunteers like Noor Ismail, however, it has become less of an ordeal.\\nHomework support groups were introduced by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and several of its partner organizations as a way of helping refugee students keep up with schoolwork and encourage them to attend regularly. At present, there are 325 active homework support groups in Lebanon – in tents, shelters, community centres, living rooms and even outdoors.\\nUniversity student Noor heard about the homework support sessions from a friend. (Houssam Hariri, camera / Dalal Mawad, producer)\\nBesides UNHCR, the aid organizations Save the Children, Caritas, Terre des Hommes and the International Rescue Committee are also involved in running activities in venues that children can attend. The unpaid volunteers, most of whom have backgrounds in education, are mainly refugees themselves, but Lebanese such as Noor have also become involved.\\nA 22-year-old Lebanese university student majoring in political science, Noor heard about the homework support sessions from a friend who was already volunteering. She first started helping out at a support group run by Caritas in the town of Saida, in southern Lebanon, in October 2016. “I’ve been a facilitator ever since,” she says.\\nTwice a week, she works with groups of children aged between 10 and 15, not just to help them with homework, but to talk through any problems they may be having in class.\\nShe loves her responsibilities and cares strongly about her new charges, aware of the pressures refugee children, particularly girls, are under to support their families. “I consider them as my siblings and want them to thrive.”\\n“I consider them as my siblings and want them to thrive.”\\nMore than 2,500 children attended homework support programmes in Lebanon in the 2016-2017 academic year. About three-quarters of the groups continued throughout the summer, even after school was over. The volunteers and students went over what was covered in lessons to make sure the children were ready to move on to the next grade..\\nOne of Noor\\'s students, 10-year-old Maria, found the transition from the Syrian education system to her Lebanese school difficult because of the language barrier. “When I was in Syria, our curriculum was all in Arabic, but here it is mostly in English. When I came here, I didn’t know a word of English but Noor taught me everything. I love these sessions.”\\nFor Noor, the sessions are about more than school work. “I give them moral support,” she says. “I talk to them about their future and the importance of education.\\n“Education is their only weapon”.\\nNoneHis claims of having a girlfriend met with scorn – one of his neighbours had told them everything.

In some cases, home has become such a terrifying place that the only option is to leave.\\nAlong with other internally displaced LGBTI people from non-government controlled territories in Ukraine, Viktor found help from an organization called Insight, which runs a shelter and offers legal aid for those without the means to support themselves.\\n“It is not easy to be LGBTI in the East,” says its director, Olena Shevchenko. “They can beat you, they can rape you. It’s not possible to be open, because you’re never sure what will happen next. You need to lead a hidden life.”\\nOlena Shevchenko, a human rights activist, sits at her desk at Insight\\'s office in Kyiv.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Anastasia Vlasova\\nNone\\nViktor spent four months at the Insight shelter in Kyiv, trying to find a job and a place to live. For internally displaced people (IDPs), who face negative stereotypes in Ukraine, this can be difficult. But for gay or transgender people the stigma doubles.\\nOn top of this, there is the constant worry about the conflict back home and loved ones left behind.\\n“Many people who come to the shelter still have parents back in Donetsk and Luhansk,” says Shevchenko. “There’s always some military operation so you never know if your house will be next. You don’t have any income, because you can’t find a job, and if somebody hurts you where do you go? It’s an awful life.”\\n\"They tormented me for hours.\"\\nFor Oleg, a 22-year-old drama student from Donetsk, it was his own mother who reported him to police and forced him to see a psychologist.\\n“When my mum first found out I was gay, she didn’t understand,” he says. “It was very shocking for her. She called the police three times to scare me – the first two times they came to our home and just spoke with me, but the third time they took me to the station. They tormented me for hours and told me I was a faggot. I was terrified. When I got home, I remember I said: ‘You are not my mum, because mums don’t do this.\\' We didn’t speak for a long time.”\\nAt high school, Oleg was beaten and called names.\\n“I call it fox hunting,” he says. “They ran after me and I hid.

His mother fled a few months later when their street came under attack. Miraculously, their house remains undamaged, but it is worth little in a conflict zone and neither of them expect to return.\\n“It’s like a big snowball,” says Oleg. “For me, it was not only about the war – it was also about discrimination and LGBTI identity. It came all at once and you just disappear. You’re misunderstood, lost.” He sighs, with a shrug. “We don’t understand how valuable things are until we lose them.”\\nUNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, works to offer individual assistance to the most vulnerable LGBTI IDP’s in Ukraine, issuing legal guidance and training for field staff. It also supports a Ukrainian public initiative called ‘T-ema’ which helps displaced transgender people and is run by participants of a recent UNHCR focus group discussion with representatives of the displaced LGBTI community. In July, the agency took part in Kyiv Pride.\\n\"It takes courage, it takes bravery.”\\nFor Oleg, and many others like him, their future in Ukraine is uncertain. “I can’t go home because I will be in a jail or be killed. I don’t see that I can have a normal life in Ukraine, even in Kyiv. It’s a fight every day and I don’t want it. I want to be normal – I want to have a house and a husband and cats.” He shakes his head, sadly. “We haven’t fought for our rights yet. We haven’t this background. It takes courage, it takes bravery.”\\nOlena from Insight is among those ready to lead the charge.\\n“People in Ukraine need their rights and they need protection,” she says. “And they are ready to demand it.”\\n\\xa0\\n* Name has been changed for protection reasonsAt home in the Darfur region of Sudan, Hosna’s family were farmers and herders. Like every other young woman she knew, she got married and had a family. Then war broke out and armed men raided her village. They killed five men from her family, including her husband.\\nThat day, Hosna gathered her children up and her belongings and left home. After arriving in Chad in 2003, she remarried and had two more children. After her second husband divorced her, she was left to raise them alone.\\nHosna, her five children and one grandchild now live in a refugee camp near the Chadian town of Goz Beida. At first, they struggled to find food, clothing and shelter but, as aid arrived and their lives stabilized, Hosna began to look to the future. “I realized it was important for my children to get an education,” she says. “They have no father. They only thing they have for their future is education.”\\nSudanese refugee Hosna Idris Abdallah never gave up her desire to learn.\\nThe thought struck her that she wanted to be a part of it. “Back home in Darfur no one ever thought about taking me to school. I decided to go because I had never had the opportunity.”\\n“People find it strange that I go to school with my children … but I will never give up.”\\nFitting in an education as well as providing for her children has been difficult. Hosna, 37, gets her children up early and all go to collect firewood, which they can sell for food.\\n“I have to take them to school after work,” says Hosna. “I have only a few hours to make sure I make enough money to feed all of them.” She also looks for odd jobs in the market but says that, as a single mother, she often gets paid less than she should.\\nLife in the classroom has also been tough. Hosna is by far the oldest – indeed, she started in kindergarten along with her youngest children. “The first time I went to school, even my own children were laughing at me.”\\nIt took several attempts to pass her first exams and a long time to reach the end of primary school. However, she made it into secondary school, which she attends with her daughter, Khadija, 15. They are in the same classes and help each other with their homework.\\n“People find it strange that I go to school with my children. Some say, ‘your life is already hard enough without doing this to yourself – better to give up and stay at home and look after your children.’ But I will never give up.”\\nNone“Okay, let’s hustle,” shouts Shauna Gillan, first mate and second-in-command. “Omran, Hamza, you’re going to hoist the sail,” she orders, standing steady on the rocking deck.\\n“Sails up,” comes the response, as Hamza Alsayed Hassen, 17, and Oisín Ryan, 16, grimace with the effort of hoisting the sails aloft.\\nThe two youngsters crank the winch and tie off the rope. With that, the boat turns on its axis, the sails fill, and it moves forward, leaving the safety of the harbour and sweeping into the Atlantic. “I like the responsibility,” says Hamza. “You have to work together, because otherwise you won’t get to where you want.”\\n“You can see a solid team mentality start to form from day one.”\\nHe is one of 10 teenagers, five Syrian and five Irish, all between the ages of 15 and 17, who are learning to sail in the hazardous conditions around the Irish coast. In the space of a week, they will learn to steer, operate the winch, hoist sails and coil ropes neatly, all the time working together to keep afloat.\\nNone\\nIt is a novel way to bring young people from different backgrounds together, and the brainchild of first mate Gillan, a human rights lawyer when she is not sailing.\\n“Sail training is an ideal way to foster bonds between different communities,” she says. “It’s the ultimate leveller. Everyone is thrown into an equally unfamiliar environment – their background before they’ve come on board becomes less important. You can see a solid team mentality start to form from day one.”\\nThe course is part of a project called Safe Haven Ireland (camera: Alex St Denis / producer: Warda Al-Jawahiry)\\nOmran Al Awihi, 15, came to Ireland in March. Like the other Syrians on board, he arrived via the European Union’s relocation scheme, which distributes asylum-seekers arriving in Greece and Italy\\xa0to other countries in the EU. Ireland pledged to accept 1,152 people from Greece and Italy under the scheme by September 2017 and, so far, 524\\xa0have been transferred from Greece.\\nAfter a year and two months in Greece, Omran arrived in Ireland in March, moving with other Syrians to the town of in the west of Ireland.\\n“I knew Ireland was in the middle of the sea,” he says, although he never thought he would be sailing around it.\\nIn the few days he has been on the boat, Omran has taken control of the wheel and learned to use the winch, hoist the sails and pull up the anchor, ensuring it does not get caught in the seaweed that is everywhere on the sea off County Cork in south-west Ireland. The only thing he does not enjoy is cleaning. “I’m the youngest in my family so am not used to washing the dishes,” he says.\\nHowever, the week’s sailing has left him in no doubt about his future career. “I want to be a sailor,” he says, smiling.\\nAbove all, the goal is to have fun. “Sometimes we have too much,” says Kayli Smyth, 17, one of the Irish teenagers, also from Ballaghaderreen.\\n“We’re having craic most of the time” she says, using an Irish term that sums up fun, conversation and good times. “Sometimes too much craic!”\\nThe Syrian boys left the hatch open the previous night, she says, which let in water from a night-time deluge and caused the girls on board to get wet through the next day. “We were soaked!”\\nThey have remained friends and all look forward to meeting up at their local youth club the following week. That seems like a natural decision now, but just months ago “a lot of people were suspicious of the Syrians at first,\" says Diarmaid Geever, 16, one of the Irish teenagers from Ballaghaderreen.\\n“But now they have a better understanding. Generally speaking, people are very supportive and see that the Syrians are exactly the same as ourselves. If you put us all in a small confined space, with all our different personalities, you find that we all get on. They like music and games just like us. There are differences, but far fewer than some people think.”Before she and her family fled their home in the town of Nasser, Nyahok would watch, enthralled, as United Nations aircraft carrying aid supplies flew in and out of the nearby airport.\\n“My dream has always been to be a pilot,” she said. “When I was young, I saw a lot planes flying around Nasser. I saw the pilots when they got out of the planes and their fancy uniforms. I want to see every country.”\\nNow living in Kule refugee camp in Gambella, Ethiopia, the 16-year-old knows that secondary education is the only way of turning her dream into reality. However, there is only limited first-year secondary education available in the region. After that, hardly any adolescent refugees have a classroom to go to. The region is one of the least developed and remote in Ethiopia and more refugees are arriving all the time.\\nFor Nyahok, hope was provided briefly by her uncle, who lives in Kenya and who offered to pay her secondary school fees. With her parents’ support, she left the camp for Nairobi to pursue her studies.\\nAfter six months, however, her uncle ran out of money. “It soon became hard for him and he couldn’t pay the school fees anymore,” she says, staring at her feet as she sits on her bed, chatting with her father, Reath Kun.\\nBefore she was forced to flee with her family, Nyahok was inspired by watching UN aircraft flying in and out of the airport near her home in Nasser, South Sudan.\\nThe South Sudan conflict has created the fastest-growing refugee population in the world. Of more than 1.8 million South Sudanese who have fled, 62 per cent are under 18. There are almost 340,000 South Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia, classified as one of the world\\'s least developed countries and already struggling to educate its own people\\n“I am very proud of her, for her achievements in school and for her drive.”\\nThe Ethiopian government has said it will improve access to education at all levels, for refugees and its own people, but it faces significant obstacles. Only 9 per cent of secondary-school-age refugee children in Ethiopia have a place in a classroom, well below the rate for refugees globally of 23 per cent and a long way from the 84 per cent figure for their non-refugee peers.\\nThat means that youngsters such as Nyahok run out of opportunities, no matter how much they have committed themselves at primary school.\\n“I did not have the chance to go to school,” says her father. “I lived in a remote area in Nasser and there were no schools in the area. Nyahok, I want her to go to school. I am very proud of her, for her achievements in school and for her drive.”\\nBerhanu Geneti, an education officer in Gambella for UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, says refugee children and adolescents are “eager to learn and make something of their lives”. However, funding constraints mean a shortage of classrooms, text books and teachers.\\nBecause Nyahok was unable to finish the past school year, she will now start in grade 8. Despite the setback, she still has her eyes on the skies. “It would make me very sad if my dream of becoming a pilot could not come true.”\\nThat would enable her to explore the world and take care of her family. She also wants to blaze a trail for South Sudanese girls like herself. “I want to be an advocate and a role model for them.”\\nFor now, she says, “all I can think of is my education, finishing school. I would leave again if I had to, to get my education”.\\nNoneHe strides towards the administration block, drops off his books in the office he shares with the school principal and turns to look at the first few pupils arriving.\\n“When I joined here there were more than 6,000 pupils in this school,” he says, as the sound of stamping and shuffling feet gradually fills the chill morning air.\\nThe trickle of arrivals turns into a torrent. By now students are pouring in from all directions.\\nUganda: Yangani Primary School has 5,000 pupils\\nWhen it first opened several months ago, there was a rush to enrol, and the school was forced to turn some children away because of the lack of space, reducing the number to about 5,000 today, which, Patrick notes, is “a very big number”.\\nPatrick, a Ugandan, is a deputy principal in charge of academic studies and administration at Yangani. It is a Ugandan state school and, although the children are mostly refugees, there are some local pupils here, too.\\nDespite the pupil numbers, the school has a staff of only 38. In 10 years of teaching, Patrick has worked in some difficult environments but Yangani is on a different scale.\\nSpread over roughly two acres, the school is a patchwork of tattered plastic tents, many with holes, flapping in the wind. A sloping valley separates the administration area and upper primary classes on one side from the lower primary classes on the other. Inside the classrooms the temperature soon rises and children squirm in discomfort.\\n“Things are really tough here because there just isn’t enough space for all the students,” Patrick says, gesturing into one of the classrooms.\\nA glance inside reveals a crowded scene: children occupy every available space, with as many as five sharing a desk. Some sit on the floor, others stand at the back and in the aisles, clutching their books to their chests.\\n“Sometimes, because of the congestion, they stand next to the teacher at the front of the class,” Patrick says.\\nYangani school opened in February this year to cater to the rapidly growing numbers of South Sudanese refugees. Uganda has been among the most generous countries in its response to the influx, welcoming refugees, giving them plots of land and making public services, including education, available.\\nNow host to nearly 2 million people who have fled South Sudan, 60 per cent of them children, Uganda is struggling to keep up.\\nAccording to the education ministry, the standard teacher-to-student ratio should be one to 45. There should be three children to a desk, and 14 to every lavatory.\\nYangani breaches these rules by a wide margin. As an administrator, Patrick tries to ensure that learning materials are shared equally across the classes. “We now have 279 textbooks for all students, so you can imagine how tough it is to share,” he says. That is one textbook to every 18 children.\\nUNHCR, the Ugandan education ministry and partner organizations are looking for ways to increase capacity, setting up more schools and working with national and local officials to identify existing ones that can expand.\\n“Schools like Yangani are filling a crucial gap.”\\nIn this way, they hope to bring more refugee children into the national education system and raise standards for refugees and local communities. Uganda cannot do this on its own. “The government is already doing its level best, so we are calling for more donor support to fill the gaps,” says Julius Okello, a UNHCR field officer in Bidibidi.\\nI am introduced to 17-year-old Bashir, who fled his home in South Sudan last November. Now he lives in Bidibidi as an unaccompanied minor. His parents stayed behind but he has no idea what has happened to them.\\nThere were no other schools nearby so he had to wait for months before Yangani opened and he could enrol. Bashir is in his last year of primary school and he says he is doing his best to study diligently, but admits it can be hard.\\n“We don’t have enough books,” he says. “If you get a little money, you can buy some, but most students can’t afford them. Some of us who don’t have parents here struggle.”\\nThe brimful classrooms are evidence that there is plenty of demand for education. Most refugees are settled in areas a long way from existing state-run schools. Setting up new ones not only gets refugee children into the national education system, but also raises capacity and standards for local communities. “Schools like Yangani are filling a crucial gap,” Okello says.\\nHowever, it is difficult for children to learn under such constrained circumstances. “There are no boundaries to separate the classes. Two different classes take place next to each other, so whatever is being taught in one class is heard in the next one.”\\nPatrick surveys the ranks of children before heading off to teach another class. “Imagine only 38 teachers for all these students,” he says. “You can get overwhelmed.”\\nNone“One day the gang’s hitman showed up at the house and asked the son sitting on the stoop for a glass of water,” says Cecilia, a community leader. “When he came back out with the water, they shot him dead.”\\nThat was retribution for the boy’s mother allegedly talking to military police. The gang later sent the mother a message, says Cecilia: if she wanted to live, she must leave by the morning and never come back.\\nThis is the fate of thousands of Hondurans who do not follow the orders of the gang that controls their neighbourhood. For years, the street gangs MS-13 and Barrio 18 have battled street by street for control of cities and towns in Honduras.\\nForcing people to leave their homes or their land is how the gangs root out opponents and establish dominance. Abandoned houses also serve as warning signs to potential snitches, as buffer zones in disputed territories and as points of strategic control.\\nNone\\nThree families in Cecilia’s community have recently abandoned their homes. In the next neighbourhood up the hill, she has heard of three of four more. Down the hill she has heard of others.\\xa0\\nNone\\n“Displacement from homes is particularly affecting communities that have been traditionally marginalized.”\\n“It’s important to recognize that displacement from homes is particularly affecting informal communities in Honduras, communities that have been traditionally marginalized and excluded,” says Andres Celis, the UNHCR representative in Honduras.\\nIn an effort to prevent forced displacement and mitigate the impact of violence UNHCR is working on the ground in Honduras to strengthen community networks and infrastructure. Among its efforts, it has helped to draft protection measures to be included in a bill on forced displacement.\\nAlong with Caritas, UNHCR has also begun a process to identify abandoned houses in Tegucigalpa and will extend it throughout 56 parishes in the country. The information collected will then be shared with governmental entities to guarantee its inclusion in a registration system for any restitution processes in the future.\\nAn abandoned house in the La Era district of the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, where gang violence is forcing out residents. Displacement is particularly affecting communities that have been traditionally marginalized and excluded.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Tito Herrera\\nCecilia’s neighbourhood is located on treacherous dirt roads that lead up the slopes outside Tegucigalpa. It is one of hundreds of informal communities, many of which sprung up after the devastation of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which displaced more than 1 million people. However, the neighbourhoods were never zoned or formally established, meaning they often lack basic services, even roads.\\nNone\\n“They usually can’t do anything because they are terrified of getting in between anyone else and the gangs,” says Cecilia.\\nThe legal ambiguity around property in these communities makes it even more difficult for victims of displacement to get anything for their property. Cecilia has only heard of one displaced family that successfully sold their home. However, in their desperation to sell, the family sold their house for 50,000 lempiras, roughly US$2,000, about a quarter of its real value.\\n“One of the biggest questions we must ask is what happens when people are able to return?”\\n“I think many of the people who leave have the hope of coming home,” says Cecilia. “But so far I haven’t seen anyone able to come back and claim their land.”\\nDisplacement in these informal communities reinforces a cycle of poverty and disenfranchisement. Inadequate police do not protect these communities from gangs. The gangs displace anyone who does not\\xa0obey them, and families are left penniless, without the small amount of wealth they have been able to build.\\xa0\\n“It’s totally disempowering, to be ripped from your life like that,” says Cecilia.\\nEven once Honduras is able to bring peace to its gang conflict, displacement will weigh heavy on Hondurans.\\nFor that reason, a registration system for land and housing abandoned because of forced displacement is key for restitution and lasting solutions.\\n“One of the biggest questions we must ask is what happens when people are able to return?” says Cecilia. “There is no plan in place for allowing people to come back to their home or land.”\\n*Some names have been changed for protection purposes.But as a Syrian refugee and 12-time national champion, he’s also used to overcoming the odds, no matter how much they’re stacked against him.\\nMohammed is determined to instill the same strength in students at the National Capital Wrestling Club, run out of St. Patrick’s High School in Ottawa. Now the Canadian capital’s only Arabic-speaking wrestling coach, he aims to produce nothing less than world champions.\\nOriginally from Dara’a, Syria, Mohammed has been wrestling all his life. “It teaches you discipline,” he says. ”It teaches you how to keep pushing.”\\n“It teaches you discipline.\"\\nOriginally from Dara\\'a, Syria, Mohammed has been wrestling all his life (Annie Sakkab, camera)\\nIt was those skills he drew on when the war closed in on his family’s home.\\nHe fled, along with his wife Asmaa and parents, to Jordan’s sprawling Za’atari refugee camp.\\n“We were living a normal life and, all of a sudden, we moved from a house to a tent,” he says.\\nWhile the structure of his previous life evaporated, Mohammed still had sport and the love of his wife, who gave birth to their first child in the camp. But, around him, he saw many other, younger people without direction and goals.\\nCommitted to changing this, Mohammed started a wrestling programme. It began as a rag-tag group of three boys but soon he was approached by Mercy Corps, a humanitarian aid organization that offered him funding if he could develop a clear plan for the programme. For 15 days, he pored over strategies and ideas, before presenting them with a proposal. They loved it.\\nEventually, this morphed into what he says was a training programme that coached more than 25,000 youth over a period of four years.\\n“We did not use medals to show achievements,” says Mohammed. “We did it to provide emotional and mental support – to add a dream or hope to young people’s lives.”\\n\"I forgot all the pains and all the suffering that we had gone through.\"\\nIn 2016, a group of eight friends in Ottawa heard about Mohammed and his young family, who by now had lived in Za’atari for four years. Led by Jessie Thompson, the group partnered with a local church and raised CAD$45,000 in only three weeks to sponsor the family for resettlement.\\nFinally, on a chilly November, Mohammed and his family arrived in Ottawa.\\n“After the suffering of a long journey, when I saw the people welcoming me at the airport, I forgot all the pains and all the suffering that we had gone through,” recalls Mohammed. “They started to applaud for us. I truly felt a great happiness.”\\nOnce in Canada, Mohammed quickly sought out a local wrestling club, using the sport to reorient himself. Today, he constantly volunteers to help out other new arrivals.\\n“I lost the first round of my life when I had to leave my home,” says Mohammed. “But I’m ready to win the next round.”None\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone“Don\\'t cry, Mama.

The move forced 20,000 Colombians, many displaced by Colombia’s long civil war, out of the country.\\n“People arrive here with nothing, so the priority is to give people somewhere to stay.”\\n“I opened up my home two years ago when the deportations happened,” says Lamos. “I lived there, I worked there, I had a life there, so I know what it’s like to have to leave it all behind. People arrive here with nothing, so the priority is to give them somewhere to stay.”\\nSkyrocketing inflation, widespread food and medicine shortages, political unrest and violence are causing Venezuelans to flee in their tens of thousands. Many follow in Lamos’s footsteps, crossing the border by land to Cúcuta, in the hope of building a better life, in some cases applying for asylum.\\nNow back in Colombia, Lamos lives in a colonial-style house, where she offers food, shelter and solidarity to Venezuelans escaping the crisis. Her home has a central courtyard where residents mingle, sometimes eating together. The rooms are spacious, with some families sharing a bed.\\nWomen and children share a meal at former refugee Angelica Lamos\\'s home in Cúcuta, Colombia. \\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Paul Smith\\n“We have about 10 Venezuelans living here,” she says, gesticulating and animated. “Some people stay one month, or three months, until they can stand on their own two feet.

Keener González, 21, remembers the protests he saw in Caracas and the ruthless response.\\n“You can’t speak out against the government there,” he said outside Lamos’s house where he had attended a meeting on the rights of recently-arrived Venezuelans. “They beat protesters, they arrest people taking photos … I can’t live in a country like that.”\\nFor Lamos, the decision to open up her home was a simple one. “Venezuelans are living a very difficult moment and it hurts me.

Tonight he tells them: “Tomorrow the LGBTI collective will organize a party to celebrate pride and you are all invited.”\\nSince Friar Tomás founded the shelter in Tenosique in 2011, it has provided protection and humanitarian assistance to more than 50,000 people fleeing violence, extortion, forced recruitment and human rights violations in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.\\nThe Mexican Friar providing a safe haven for refugees\\nIt was the first shelter in Mexico to cater to the needs of LGBTI refugees.

They cherished tradition, he says, and balked at change. They also viewed outsiders with suspicion, so when refugee resettlement began making headlines, some worried that it could pose a security risk to the country.\\n“It was easier to be against refugees and be scared of them than try to look into who they were,” Cobi says, reflecting on his own views just a few years ago.\\nFive years ago, Cobi moved to Fayetteville to be with his wife, Leanda, and began to see things differently. Home to the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville is the state’s third-largest city, with over 80,000 residents, and has taken in several refugees in recent years.\\n“It was easier to be against refugees and be scared of them than try to look into who they were.”\\nLeanda had been working through her church to welcome some of them, and she convinced Cobi to help out. One of the first refugees he met was Majidi, 36, who fled the Democratic Republic of the Congo after witnessing his father’s murder and being tortured.\\nMajidi walked for two months to Namibia, then waited 17 years as a refugee before being selected by the U.S. Government for resettlement. He moved to Fayetteville last December, grateful for the chance to restart his life.\\nThey first met when Cobi offered Majidi’s family a ride to a nearby Islamic center for a meet-and-greet with other refugees and local families. They have been friends ever since.\\n“They opened the door, welcomed us and offered us food,” Cobi says, recalling his first encounter with Majidi’s family. Cobi had just eaten, so he declined the food. “I told them, ‘I’m worried I am going to offend you.’” Majidi’s wife, Rehema, had a similar concern, Cobi remembers. She said “We are worried we are going to offend you.”\\nArkansas resettled 90 refugees since January 2012, according to U.S. government figures.\\nMajidi and his family are settling into their new lives fast. Their two children – Ally, 4, and Khadija, 2 – go to school and day care. Majidi has a job at the university, and he and Rehema are also trying to start a small business.\\n“My dream is to be independent, be an entrepreneur and help others,” he says.\\nNow Cobi and Majidi meet up once a week – sometimes on the university’s campus, where Majidi works and Cobi studies engineering. Other times they meet at each other’s homes. Their children play together too.\\nCobi says he does his best to explain to friends and neighbors why it is important to welcome the few, vulnerable refugees who are admitted for resettlement in the United States.\\n“Our families are big friends. That is really special and means a lot to us.”\\n“They are trying to integrate with us and make us stronger, and I believe that they are,” he says. “Their dream is the American dream.”\\nStill, Cobi says many of his friends and family from his hometown struggle to understand. Some, he says, have told him he should “help his own.”\\n“I would try to talk to them, but it would never fail that they would unfriend me, block me on Facebook. I have lost people I have known for 20 years.”\\nCobi says he is happy with the path he has forged. He believes his family benefits from knowing Majidi’s family and other refugees.\\n“We are teaching our children it’s okay to help other people and to be friends with someone who doesn’t talk like you, look like you or come from the same place, or who doesn’t worship the same way you do.”\\n“Our families are big friends.

He lived in a room with hundreds of other refugees and migrants, where he was given little food and beatings occurred every day. When Solomon and the rest of the group were finally taken to board a boat bound for Italy, they were crammed onto it along with hundreds of other people.\\n“There were 900 people on the boat,” Solomon recalls. “We took off at night at about six or seven. It was difficult – the sea was rough, people were fighting, people died, some from anxiety and some from the fighting. Many people died. It was scary but what can you do when you don’t have a choice? You cannot be scared because sooner or later you have to cross.”\\nAfter two days at sea, Solomon’s boat was rescued and taken to Italy, where he was placed in a community centre for unaccompanied children.\\nAlthough he was finally safe, Solomon still hoped to be reunited with his aunt in the Netherlands. Like countless others separated from loved ones, long waiting times soon compelled him to take matters into his own hands once more, risking abuse, violence and exploitation.\\n\"Children should not expose themselves to such risks,\" says Stephane Jaquemet, UNHCR Regional Representative for Southern Europe. \"Family reunion across borders needs to improve, not only to avoid these dangers, but also to restore the hope and the trust of children\\xa0like Solomon.\"\\n\"It was very difficult,\" says Solomon. \"You give up on your life.\"\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Alessandro Penso\\nWith a group of teenagers, Solomon set out at night with only a backpack and a flashlight, following the train tracks.

The Nagu people used to be voyagers, fishermen – they are curious about the unknown and different cultures.\\xa0Instead of closing up with fear, we decided to welcome the families and children as our guests.”\\n“Welcoming refugees isn’t about organizing a lot of strange separate activities for them. It is about making sure they feel welcome to be part of what the local community is already doing.”\\nMona and Kaj are Finnish pensioners who have assumed the role of grandparents for 3-year-old Diana, a refugee from Iraq who arrived on the Finnish island of Nagu in 2015.

Eight months into their stay at a centre for asylum-seekers, the family left to go it alone – a daunting task so far away from home and without sufficient knowledge of the local language.\\nBut,\\xa0along with other refugees in Podgorica, Raul participated in a workshop organized by UNHCR, the Refugee Agency, and the Employment Office of Montenegro, to support their integration.\\nThe workshop consisted of group sessions and individual consultations with the participants, mapping their skills and interests to the job market. Afterwards, the participants also attended a five-day intensive Montenegrin language course, funded by UNHCR and tailored to help them acquire the basics of the language to allow them to interact with their prospective employers and co-workers.\\n“I really try to communicate in the local language whenever I can.\"\\nRaul, a 31-year-old Cuban refugee, works just outside the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Radonja Srdanovic\\n“It was quite short, but we learned a lot,” says Raul. “Earlier on, I could barely understand a word of Montenegrin, but I felt a significant improvement after the course. Now we have an opportunity to socialize more when we go out.”\\nRaul recently landed a job at the municipal waste collection company.\\n“This job came at the right moment, as I had been looking out for a way to start earning once we leave the centre. It is not an ideal job, as I work the whole morning in the strong sun, walking up to 10 kilometres of streets – but I have a family to support.”\\nThe workshop also enabled another Cuban refugee find work. Yaster, 34,\\xa0received refugee status in Montenegro in December 2016. He also stayed at the centre for several months, but now lives in private accommodation supported by UNHCR through a cash-based intervention on a six-month basis. Although he is a qualified nurse, Yaster makes his living in Montenegro by working at the municipal waste collection company.\\n\"I am determined to make my life here, or at least give it a try.”\\n“I am aware that I am on my own now, so I needed anything just to get started,” he says. “It’s difficult to work in the sun, so I take short breaks in the shade every now and then.”\\nYaster also attended the Montenegrin course and has since been trying to improve his command of the language by chatting with co-workers.\\n“I really try to communicate in the local language whenever I can,” he says. “Actually, that’s in most cases the only way we can interact, as English is not an option. I understand better than I speak, so I try to listen to conversations and pick up new words I hear around me. I am determined to make my life here, or at least give it a try.”\\nThe collaboration between UNHCR and the Employment Office began in early 2017 and was formalized in June through a Memorandum of Understanding, which seeks to assist newly recognized refugees in their social and economic integration.\\nYaster (front) and Raul carry refuse bags to a waste collection point.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Radonja Srdanovic\\n“Through this Memorandum we aim to provide support to the Government of Montenegro in boosting integration prospects of newly-recognized refugees, so they can become self-reliant through income generating activities,” says Roberta Montevecchi, UNHCR Representative in Montenegro. “Refugee protection and livelihoods are closely intertwined, so we believe that this initiative will help Montenegro develop a fully-functioning system that reduces the risk of refugees depending on external assistance.”\\nWhile there has not been a large number of refugees arriving to Montenegro, there are still people fleeing conflict or persecution who seek to re-build their lives in safety in this tiny Adriatic country.\\xa0\\n“This is a beautiful country and, most importantly, my children can walk freely on the streets and play in safety,” says Raul.None\\nNone\\nNone\\nNone\\nI’m from The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and during the Kosovo conflict I witnessed first-hand what it’s like to be displaced or a refugee. There were buses arriving in my village one after the other, every day for weeks. They brought women, children and elderly people without anything, just a few bags with their clothes, whatever they could grab when they left Kosovo. A lot of people from the village, me and my friends, were distributing food and water when the buses arrived. The idea of being an aid worker came from that moment when you give something away to a person that needs it. You see their face, the satisfaction. Since then I have always felt I should be a humanitarian worker.\\nMost rewarding/challenging thing about your job?\\xa0\\nThree months back, I went to Mokha. We were responding to IDPs who were literally living under the trees in the heat. You can see the faces of people when they receive assistance, even if it\\'s just a mattress and a sheet, because they literally did not have anything. But the challenge is that it’s never enough. The number of people in need is just too high. There are over two million people displaced. The most challenging part is that you can’t help all of them. When there are two families in need, you have to choose the one that is most vulnerable.\\nWhat was the best day that you had at work? \\nBack in 2012 I was in Tobruk, Libya. Refugees from Syria would arrive at the border, and I was there to deal with issues of access. I was told by officers that there were 16 unaccompanied children, all between 12 and 16, who were completely alone. When you see children in difficulty, you always relate it to your own children. I am very sensitive to that. We managed to get all these kids to Tripoli within a few days, and then we reunited them with their families. That was one of the happiest days I have had with UNHCR. When they saw their relatives again, they were so happy.\\nWhat was your worst day at work? \\nMy worst day was working in one of my previous duty stations. National security officers had arrested a 15-year-old IDP who had stolen a sheep to feed his family. They had beaten him so badly for three or four days that he had internal bleeding. When I heard about the case, he was in the local hospital. I immediately went with the local government officials to try to have the kid transported to another hospital in the capital so that he could receive proper treatment. But the national security officer threatened the doctors and ordered them not to release him, even though UNHCR had paid for the transportation. I tried so hard to get this kid out of that hospital for two days, and at the end, the kid died because of the internal bleeding. If he had left the hospital, his life would have been saved. I still remember that kid. When I talk about him, I cry. But it is situations like this that push you, and make you more determined to do your job.\\n\\xa0\\nNone\\n\\xa0Yet there are no camps in Uganda.

She has improved so we are taking her home.”\\nAya’s specialist treatment was made possible thanks to a newly constructed paediatric ward at the hospital funded by a Lebanese NGO called Birth and Beyond. Their aim is to provide quality neonatal treatment to underprivileged families in Lebanon, including Syrian refugees.\\nLebanon is home to more than a million refugees from the six-year conflict in neighbouring Syria. Around 12 per cent of children born to refugees are in need of neonatal intensive care. A leading reason for this is prematurity, which in turn can be the result of early marriage, poverty and lack of antenatal care.\\nUnfortunately, neonatal intensive care is not available in all Lebanese hospitals and refugees often need to travel long distances in order for their newborns to get the necessary treatment.\\nRobert Sacy, a paediatrician who founded Birth and Beyond, started the initiative to address the dual challenge of an insufficient number of paediatric intensive care places – especially in public hospitals – and the prohibitive cost of such treatment for underprivileged families.\\n\"This is a massive benefit to refugees that they can receive quality care free of charge.”\\n“We always have this challenge of refusing people not only due to the lack of places, but mainly because of the lack of financial support,” Sacy explained. “There’s a need to have the best treatments with the best medical staff and best equipment in governmental hospitals.”\\nLast year around 4,500 refugee babies required neonatal intensive care, according to Michael Woodman, a senior public health officer for UNHCR in Lebanon. Despite the fact that the UN Refugee Agency covers 90 per cent of the cost, families still have to cover the remaining 10 per cent, which – no matter how small – can be prohibitive for many refugee families.\\n“Initiatives like Birth and Beyond are extremely important because they provide excellent quality care for refugees integrated in a public hospital,” Woodman said. “I think this is a massive benefit to refugees that they can receive quality care free of charge.”\\nUnderprivileged children are all received with the same warmth and care, regardless of their nationality. Manal is from Tripoli, in northern Lebanon, and her infant son Oussama was admitted to the new paediatric intensive care unit at Qarantina hospital after suffering complications following heart surgery.\\n“The ward is excellent even in terms of equipment and machinery, I didn’t feel like I was in a public hospital at all,” said Manal. “The hospital is not going to cost me much. I can’t afford taking him to a private hospital, but here the government pays and so it’s better.”\\nThanks to Birth and Beyond, Oussama and Aya have been given a second chance in life, and Sacy argues that the same level of care should be granted to every child born in Lebanon, regardless of their family’s financial situation. “I don’t understand why poor people should not have the right to be treated the same way as rich people.”UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has chosen Tabu as the symbolic 1 millionth South Sudanese refugee seeking safety in Uganda since last July, when an unprecedented surge of refugee arrivals began.\\nThe plot belongs to her foster mother, Harriet, who is also from South Sudan.\\xa0 Harriet noticed her own four children playing with Tabu, her twin sister Rena and 11-year-old brother Emmanuel, who appeared to have no-one to care for them, and took them under her wing.\\nTabu and her siblings had fled fighting in their home town of Yei with their aunt.

In July as the battle to retake Mosul raged, Emad was found beneath the rubble of the old city.\\nHe was covered in dust and his small, emaciated body was wracked with injuries from shrapnel, bullets and bombs. He had only tiny morsels of food to eat in the two months before he was found, as Iraqi forces closed in on the old city in the west of Mosul.\\nThe youngster was attempting to get a drink of water near one of the bridges that span the Tigris River, which bisects the city, when he was struck by a bullet. It was the last thing he remembers, and the culmination of his terrifying ordeal\\n“Emad suffered a great deal ... but thank God he is okay.”\\nHe was subsequently reunited with his uncle, Hadi Tammo, 31, in this city in northwest Iraq. “Even though he’s injured, we’re very happy,” Tammo said.\\nOne month after his escape, Emad’s wounds had been bandaged and he had been given a haircut. But he continued to wear a sad, tired expression not normally seen on children of his age. His wounded stomach, elbow and head continued to cause him pain.\\n“Emad suffered a great deal and his family were also captured,” said Hadi, whose children and wife were kidnapped by the extremists, before managing to escape from their ordeal last year. “He’s not feeling well, but thank God he is okay.”\\nThe Yazidi community in Sinjar, northwestern Iraq, was targeted by extremists in 2014. Militants separated men and boys older than 12 years old from the rest of their families, and killed those who refused to adopt their beliefs.\\nMore than 6,000 women and girls were kidnapped and sold as slaves, among them many of Emad’s relatives. Thousands of Yazidis were massacred or died of dehydration and exhaustion as they tried to escape the onslaught.\\nThe UN has deemed their ordeal an ongoing genocide that amounts to crimes against humanity and war crimes.\\nAfter the attack, the life of Emad’s family, and the lives of many other families like theirs, changed forever.\\nEmad’s mother managed to escape captivity in 2016, and earlier this year she was relocated to the Canadian city of Winnipeg with the help of UNHCR. When Emad was rescued in\\xa0July, UNHCR connected the names of mother and child and realized who he was, said UNHCR resettlement specialist\\xa0Sarah Webster.\\nNone\\n“It was of utmost importance to us to get Emad back to his mother and siblings as soon as possible.”\\n“Family unity is one of the most important principles for UNHCR. The family provides a really important support network for people who have been through what Emad has been through,” Webster said, a few days before Emad\\'s departure. “It was of utmost importance to us to get Emad back to his mother and siblings as soon as possible.”\\nThe youngster was so excited by the prospect\\xa0of being reunited with his mom\\xa0that he had his\\xa0bags packed days in advance.\\n“He can’t wait to see his mother again after three horrific years apart,” said his uncle Hadi. “When Emad first talked to his mother they were both very happy. It was like Emad was waking up from a grave. He was almost dead. He had been injured in his belly. But for his mom, she was just very happy. It was like Emad was reborn.\"\\nFollowing his ordeal, Emad could hardly communicate when he met his relatives again because his captors had forced him to speak Arabic and not his native Kurdish. “We want him to go to school so his mind will be clear and then he can move forward with a new life,” said Hadi.\\nOnce he is settled in Canada he will be assessed and will receive specialized care which is limited or unavailable in Iraq.\\n“Children who were held in captivity for long periods of time have been subject to a range of things, such as forced labour, forced conversion, physical and psychological abuse, on top of that separation from their family members,” said Webster.\\n“Our first priority is to reunite them with their family members so that they can at least relieve this stress and separation, and then we start to focus on recovery and access to specialized services, like Emad will have in Canada.”Surrounded by minefields, crossing points are the only way to travel back and forth between conflict-torn areas in Eastern Ukraine. For many Ukrainians, this dangerous yet inevitable route is a part of their regular travel routine.\\nTo get through a checkpoint, Valentina and Gennadiy must walk about 600 metres on foot from a bus stop and then wait in line for the necessary documents, before taking two buses to get to the checkpoint on the other side. A journey like this can be hard for anyone – but for vulnerable people with limited mobility it is excruciating. “This is inhuman,” says Valentina, wiping away her tears.\\n“We did not choose to live like this.\"\\nFour-year-old Katya* and her mother regularly cross the checkpoint in the village of Marinka.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Tania Bulakh\\nThe Ukrainian authorities have registered more than 6 million crossings of the contact line since the start of 2017, already fast approaching the overall 8.5 million crossings from 2016. One of the reasons for this increased mobility is the verification procedure for social payments that was introduced by the Ukrainian government. For many vulnerable people in non-government controlled territories these payments are vital for survival, leaving them with no choice but to travel back and forth.\\n“We did not choose to live like this,” says Viktoria*, who takes her four-year-old daughter, Katya*, across the dividing line once every two months to visit her sick grandfather.

School Principal Reita Boyajian says their aptitude and application quickly became apparent.\\n“Within a year we saw how these two students are very different and special. They became top students in all subjects,” she says. “I think that if they hadn’t made it here, if they had stayed under the shelling [in Syria], or if they arrived here but couldn’t enroll in a school and continue their education, we as a community – not only Lebanese or Armenian, but as a world community – would have lost a lot.”\\nBoyajian hopes that if the sisters continue to excel in their studies and do well in their exams, they will be able to secure scholarships to attend university in Lebanon or abroad. Elder sister Taqla, 15, already has her sights on a degree that will enable her to help with the reconstruction effort in Syria once they are able to return.\\n“I would like to be a civil engineer.

Since then, her three young children have started attending a Lebanese school.\\nAfter hearing many Syrian refugee parents express embarrassment at not being able to help their children with their homework, she took matters into her own hands. Earlier this year, she decided to start a basic adult literacy class in her community of Fnaydek, in northern Lebanon. She focuses on mothers, since they spend more time at home with their children after school\\n“It\\'s such a nice feeling when you see your students improving before your eyes,\" says Fatima, who has volunteered as a teacher since February. \"When I started teaching them, they were uncomfortable and upset, since some of them could not even hold a pen properly.\"\\n\"But here, even if we speak the same language, this country is not ours … We are foreigners\"\\nClasses are held partly in Arabic and partly in French.

If I get a text message from UNHCR or another organization, I want to be able to read it.

She is an ethnic Rakhine who employs a Muslim cook and a Hindu waiter. To her, the value of all sectors of the community working together is as clear as day.\\n“It’s very important to work together.\"\\n“It’s very important to work together. If he (the cook) is absent from work, I have difficulty doing the job, if he (the waiter) is absent, I won’t be able to work,” Momo says while serving customers. “So it’s very important to be together always.”\\nIn this part of western Myanmar, where about one\\xa0million Muslims are stateless, intermittent violence has led to thousands being displaced.

The war in South Sudan has forced her into looking after a brood of younger siblings and cousins. Gladys’ own proximity to childhood appears a forgotten fact in the family, most irreversibly by Gladys herself. It falls on her to make sure the children get their studies, despite the four-hour round trip from the Imvepi refugee settlement to the school. Her days are consumed fetching water from a well, collecting firewood, making meals, cleaning inside the wooden poles and tarpaulin shelter that UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, provided for the young family when they first arrived here in northern Uganda in 2016.\\nGladys flips the pages of the album. I see families and homes that are no longer. Smiling faces from the past, a feast once laid out in a garden, a bygone birthday party, a graduation, picnics and weddings and children playing on porches. A photo of Gladys with her mother. Gladys’s mother too is gone.\\nWe sit perched on the side of a bed on which Gladys never sleeps. At night, she tucks in four of the younger children here, the other three on a mattress at the foot of this bed. Gladys sleeps on uncovered earth between bed and mattress, on the hard ground between brothers, sisters and cousins.\\nGladys speaks with hushed poise as she turns over each album page, belying the fact that she has seen at her tender age the very worst of man. She tells me she was dragged from a bus that was set on fire, with women still screaming, still inside. She was forced to watch people she knew hacked to death before her, one by one. Gladys shrugs gently. She says she doesn’t understand why she was allowed to live.\\nWe get up to leave the shelter. Outside, when I kneel to put my shoes back on, she smiles. She had said when inviting me in that it wasn’t necessary, waving shyly at the modesty of her home. Inside the shelter, everything points to human life derailed, everything a simulacrum of normalcy: the precious photo album, a few school books, a well-thumbed Bible, a crocheted blanket, a teddy bear.\\n“My perfect job would be accounting.”\\nLooking around, I spot things I have come to know well from previous travels with UNHCR, the ‘core relief items’, kitchen set, jerricans for water, a solar lamp under which the children do their homework at night, blankets, dry food rations, a hygiene kit of soap and sanitary pads. A starter pack for dignity. The basic blocks for building back a life. The shelter may be spare, but it is Gladys’ home, the place where she and the children sleep, eat, laugh, tell stories and secrets, squabble and make up. It is under its roof that they feel rooted and safe.\\nOutside, before we say our goodbyes, I ask Gladys what her great aspiration is, remembering my own dreams of seeing The Boss in concert. Gladys says she hopes to find a job so that “I can take care of my brothers and sisters and make sure they have a good education in the future.” She laughs timidly. “My perfect job would be accounting.\"\\nBack on the bumpy road out of Imvepi, heading for Adjumani on the other side of the White Nile, I can only marvel. At Gladys and her resolve. At all the other Gladyses coming across the border daily. The staggering 75,000-plus children who have fled from South Sudan either unaccompanied or separated from their families. At every border point, reception centre, or refugee settlement I visit here in Uganda, I find areas specially designated for them, the unaccompanied and separated children, the most vulnerable of the vulnerable.\\nTwo hours and a battering rainstorm later, we sit on the ferry to Adjumani. Dusk is lovely on the White Nile, the storm passed, the late sun dazzling in the water, the hump of a hippopotamus in the distance. But on the other side, the barbarity of the war in South Sudan rears its head once more. A UNHCR convoy is waiting to cross, on its way to Palorinya settlement. Inside the buses sit hundreds of refugees who, mere hours before, had crossed the border into Uganda having fled a new outbreak of violence in the town of Pajok. I watch them exiting the buses, boys still in school uniforms, mothers, exhausted, bewildered men.\\nThey gather in shocked silence in a clearing by the ferry dock to wait for their crossing. One of the men tells me that soldiers opened fire on the streets of Pajok, in hospitals, in schools. People dropped everything and ran. Those who could not – the old, the infirm – were slaughtered. Families scattered into the bush, he says, the town emptied in hours. His family spent three days without food, living on wild roots, hiding in the bush and walking to the border. I look around me and see little in the way of belongings. Many here are barefoot. I pass a young mother breastfeeding, the infant only a week old.\\nUganda’s policy is not only progressive and compassionate, but also smart.\\nIn the tired children spilling from these buses, I see the defining faces of the refugee crisis in South Sudan, Africa’s largest and fastest growing. Over 1.8 million refugees have fled into neighbouring countries, nearly 1 million to Uganda. Most, 62 per cent, are children, frightened, confused, desperate for shelter and protection.\\nI watch my colleagues interacting with the newly arrived refugees from Pajok, asking them questions, reassuring them that once they reach the reception centre, staff will help them with food, protection, water, shelter and medical care. I admire the work being done here on the front line of the crisis, even though, astonishingly, depressingly, UNHCR’s South Sudan emergency appeal is currently only 14 per cent funded. I see in these busloads of refugees the urgent need for critical funds. Not least because humanitarian organisations are supporting a refugee response model, here in Uganda, that is ambitious and visionary and should not be allowed to fail.\\nThis trip to Uganda differs from visits I have made to refugee operations in other countries. The most glaring difference here is the absence of fenced-off refugee camps. Rather, in remarkable acts of generosity and solidarity, individual and community landowners, as well as the government, donate land to the refugees. At the banks of the White Nile, as I watch the tired refugees from Pajok, I feel a little hope knowing that within a few days they will be allocated a plot of land on which to build their emergency shelters.\\nThey will be free to start cultivating crops there to become less reliant on aid. Refugees in Uganda are allowed to move freely, to access the same health care and education systems as nationals, and they are allowed to work and own businesses. Uganda has its own painful history. It understands well that protracted war forces refugees to live in exile for years on average, often decades, and it has learned that all parties are best served when refugees are incorporated into national development plans, instead of being viewed strictly through a humanitarian lens.\\nUganda’s policy is not only progressive and compassionate, but also smart, as it helps better the lives of its own citizens.\\nTake the case of Bidibidi. A small village in north Uganda that, in just nine months, has grown into one of the world’s largest refugee settlements with over 272,000 inhabitants. Before the refugees arrived, there was no school here, no health care centre, no graded roads. I sit under a tree with a local Ugandan farmer named Yahaya. He tells me that previously his youngest children weren’t receiving an education as the nearest primary school was a prohibitively long walk away. It used to take days to get his crops to market and back, he says, but with the new roads it now takes him a few hours. Yahaya has donated land through the government scheme but also directly to refugees who have asked for extra land to cultivate. In this functional co-existence, made possible by Uganda’s refugee policy, I see the power of pragmatic generosity.\\n\"Someone had to give her a home, give her somewhere safe to live.”\\nBy the time we leave Bidibidi, I will have witnessed also the power of human generosity.\\nAisha has big, kind eyes, a slender frame. She is 29, an abandoned wife, and mother to two boys, aged 13 and 5. Last August, she fled South Sudan with her sons, a young niece and nephew. She tells me about a checkpoint stop, a soft tremble of indignation creeping into her voice, at which she was forced to kneel, her younger son in her clutch, the barrel of a gun pointed at her head. Death was a breath away.\\nIn the end, the soldiers took her money and belongings. Aisha and the children arrived in northern Uganda with next to nothing to call their own. They received a UNHCR emergency shelter and Aisha quickly went about building a more permanent home from mud bricks she made herself, and thatching a roof from grass that she collected from the bush, one bushel a day. It was hard work, she says, but she saw to it that the children were sheltered, fed, clothed, enrolled in school.\\nWhen Aisha agreed to become a foster parent, the children were excited to have a new sibling to play with. But when Aisha met the foster child, she found that she was paralysed on the right side of her body and doubly incontinent. She had been abandoned by her own mother. Aisha was told she could not feed herself or sit up or speak. She needed uninterrupted care and attention. Aisha spent a night in prayer. In the morning, she knew.\\n“I love her as my own now. But her condition is not easy,” Aisha says to me. “It is not easy for someone to accept her. But I cannot give up. Someone had to give her a home, give her somewhere safe to live.”\\nShe considered three names for the child: Gloria, Mercy, and Grace. She decided on Mercy, Aisha says, her fleeting smile an acknowledgment of the simple and poignant poetry of her choice.\\nBut if given the choice, grateful as she is to Uganda, Aisha would prefer to go home. Gladys told me the same thing. So does David, a former director of education in South Sudan, who now teaches refugee and Ugandan children in Nyumanzi Integrated Primary School. We are standing outside an empty classroom during his break time, talking about the school, when he pauses, his eyes going liquid. “Sometimes I wonder why God created me a refugee,” he says softly. “How long must I be a refugee? When can I go home and help my own people?”\\n\"It’s our wish that in your new home here you can make your children’s dreams and aspirations come true.\"\\nEvery refugee I have met – in Uganda, Chad, Jordan, Iraq, refugees from my own native Afghanistan – has echoed this wish. Nothing can replace the deep sense of connection with your birthplace. But when going back to your own country isn’t an option, home becomes the place where you feel a sense of belonging. A place where people don’t look at you and say ‘you don’t belong here’. And there are too many voices of fear in the world right now telling refugees they are not wanted.\\nI think of a lovely moment that unfolds daily at the Koluba collection centre, where refugees are first brought for a hot meal and medical screening ahead of being allotted their land. Every morning, a representative from the Ugandan Office of the Prime Minister picks up a microphone and addresses them. Her smile is open.\\n“You have come here to ensure the safety of your children,” she says. “They are the hope and they are the future. It’s our wish that in your new home here you can make your children’s dreams and aspirations come true. Welcome to Uganda.”\\nNone\\nNone“Nothing can hold you back,\" says Osman. \"If you work hard, get education, you will advance.\"\\nHe attended university in Toronto to study electrical engineering and found a job shortly after graduation.\\nBut that was not enough for Osman. Years later, when civil war engulfed Somalia and refugees fled to Canada, he started a community organization to welcome and assist new arrivals. It is still running today, helping young people by offering scholarships and entrepreneurial training. “We feel if we produce successful youth, we pay back the debt that we owe to Canada, which welcomed us,\" he says.\\nNone“I began to wonder, what will my life be?” he says. “Because at the beginning, it was hard. I was in a shelter.”\\nUndeterred by the daunting obstacles and towering buildings of Toronto, Jean-Claude threw himself into school to distract from the loneliness of his new surroundings. His perseverance paid off – he soon found a job as a community service worker, helping those in need in the community.\\nLast year, he anxiously clutched a bouquet of flowers at the same airport he had arrived at nine years earlier, waiting for his wife, Desiree, to step through the doors.\\n“You can\\'t imagine…” he says, trailing off, gazing at her in the modest apartment they share today. To his left, the flowers are still in a vase – dried out, but forever a reminder of the challenges and joys of their new home.\\n“When you can feed your family, when you can just help friends, when you can just contribute to the community, it means you are a free person,” he says. “Now I have the vision to make my life the fullest possible.”\\nNoneNone\\nThe refugees who visit every week can learn different skills such as painting, weaving, ceramics, cooking and agriculture.\\n“We don’t really have any expectations of anyone,” says Ben. “But what we normally find is that people have skills to share and they don’t normally have an expression for that.”\\n\"They realize that an asylum-seeker is not a statistic, it’s a real person.\"\\nNone\\n“Before I came here, I stayed at home,” says Noah. “I felt I was in prison and I couldn’t practice my English with anyone.”\\n“The first time Noah came here, he came with two other Sudanese men,” says Ben. “They were very quiet, straight on their phones, sort of buried in their own little world. One day he asked if he could build an oven and we said, ‘go for it,’ because we enable opportunity as much as possible. He built the most beautiful oven and made bread for everyone and we realized he is a cook. He is an amazing cook.”\\nRefugees who visit can learn skills such as painting, weaving and ceramics.\\nWhen Noah arrived in the UK, he was detained for 72 hours before being transferred to a reception facility, which became his home for a month before he moved to Norwich.\\nBut not all those who come to the UK are detained for a short time like Noah. There is currently no limit on the time the UK government can detain asylum-seekers and UNHCR is advocating for the increased use of alternatives to detention. In 2016, over 38,000 people sought asylum in Britain, according to the Home Office, and 13,200 asylum-seekers were held in immigration detention. Over 3,200 were being detained under immigration rules at the end of March 2017.\\nNow Noah has a ‘leave to remain’ permit, allowing him to work and study in the UK with the possibility of applying for citizenship after a few years.\\nEager to learn new skills to help him fully integrate into British society and give something back to the community, Noah is currently studying English, chemistry and biology so he can go back to university and study medicine. In his free time, he acts with a local theatre group and eagerly awaits Mondays so he can sign up for the bus that takes him and others to the Grange later in the week.\\nBen says the local community has been very supportive of the farm’s initiative.\\n“We have people donating things, donating time, volunteering and a lot of people who might have been mistrustful of asylum-seekers because of what they read in the media. They realize that an asylum-seeker is not a statistic, it’s a real person who has been through trauma and has a lot to offer.”\\n“The fact that they come here, share their food and cooking from all over the world, has really been fantastic for the village,” concludes Ben. “We feel privileged to just be accepted by them.”“I\\'m going to miss going every day there,” says Gladys, who says she really means it this time. Now 70, she is five years past Canada’s official retirement age. “The kids... they\\'re special.”\\nWhen she first got the job 25 years ago, the children raved to their parents about her cooking. Puzzled, the parents asked what her secret was. Gladys assured them there was nothing special about the products she used, all but one sourced from a local grocery store.\\n“My first ingredient, that I pour over, is love,” she says. “And [the parents] just laugh! They say ‘Gladys, you\\'re gonna make me cry’.”\\nHelping others has been a central theme in the life she has built since arriving in Canada back in 1988. Gladys, her husband and their three children were among thousands of Salvadorans who fled a bloody civil war at home and reached safety in Canada.\\nNone\\nGladys left behind a career as a social worker and a teaching position at a college in her Central American homeland, and took a factory job upon arriving in Ontario. “My only purpose was the safety of my family,” she recalls.\\nWith the support of the new community around her, Gladys made the most of new opportunities to work and study.\\n“When I was younger, I remember my mom working early in the morning. She came for lunch, maybe a nap, and then ran out, taught classes and, later at night, continued with her own education at university,” recalls her son Alexes, who is now 47 and a union organizer for vulnerable workers in Canada.\\nGladys Zuniga left behind her professional and personal life when she fled El Salvador (Annie Sakkab, camera)\\nAfter Gladys began working at the day-care centre, others in the community stepped up to help the family to settle in.\\n“We found a lot of people who helped us,” Gladys recalls. “Beautiful people who gave us a hand and made us feel like we were at home.”\\nIn return, Gladys has given back. She started an organization to help vulnerable farm labourers navigate life in Ontario when they did not speak the language. She has also volunteered with elderly immigrants whose social networks are limited.\\n“I always say to my kids: when you have a chance to help other people, just do it,” she says.\\nIn the heat of summer, she tends the small garden behind her house. Braided into the greenery are strings of lights for when she entertains the many friends and family – including five grandchildren – who often converge at her house.\\n“I feel, at this moment, I did good,” she says. “I made the right decision to come over here. I\\'ve done it and that\\'s the most important thing for me. This is home. This is home now.”\\nHer children agree. “El Salvador – it’s our culture and we keep that,” says Alexes. “But when we travel the world and people ask us: ‘Where are you from?’ I say I\\'m Canadian. And proud of it.”\\nNoneHe found the village, scraped together enough money for a plot of land and began subsistence farming. Nearly 30 years later, he makes a comfortable living, growing cabbages, cucumbers, tomatoes and more to sell in the Belizean capital, Belmopan. One of his sons has gone to university and a daughter is on her way there.\\nJuan\\xa0is one of hundreds of Central American refugees who found sanctuary in the aptly named Valley of Peace and he is hoping to pass the help and encouragement he found on to a new generation of refugees.\\nOn a sweltering afternoon, he kneels over a beat-up motorcycle with Benjamin and Carlos Menendez, two teenage brothers from El Salvador who live next door with their mother and four other brothers. Barrera\\xa0told the boys they could use the bike if they fixed it.\\xa0\\nHe met the Menendez in 2016 after the family of 10 fled a new wave of violence sweeping through their Central American homeland and he saw himself in the family’s six young sons.\\n“The first thought you have is ‘We’ve lived through that’,” says Barrera, now 50. “You see someone like that and you just want to help.”\\nBefore the troubles that drove them to flee to Belize, the Menendez family was happy in El Salvador. Their father, Roberto, had a successful career in the army before retiring and becoming a salesman in their home town. The mother, Juana, spent her days in the family bakery. Then it all came crashing down.\\n“You see someone like that and you just want to help.”\\nIn the northern part of Central America, murderous street gangs such as MS-13 and Barrio 18 commit crimes ranging from murder and extortion to kidnapping and drug dealing. They force young men to join their ranks and recruit young women for sex.\\nEach of the six Menendez sons faced harassment and threats from the gangsters. They all resisted, even when that meant they could barely leave home. Every time they did leave, Juana worried that one of them would not return.\\nOne day, Juan Roberto, 10, witnessed gangsters fleeing shortly after they carried out a kidnapping, and told his parents. That turned the family into a target. On top of that, father Roberto had refused to pay the so called “war tax” demanded by the gang. Since he was a former military officer, the gang labelled him an enemy.\\nJust days later, several gangsters came for Roberto. He was given an ultimatum: come out peacefully and we will finish you off or we will start killing your sons one by one. He chose to shield his family and was found dead by police later that day, shot several times and hacked with a machete.\\nOverwhelmed by grief and fear, the family left town the same day. They rented a house in another neighbourhood and lay low for nearly a month. Young Juan Roberto blamed himself for his father’s death, saying over and over, “God is cruel.”\\xa0\\nA bureaucratic snarl-up meant they were unable to withdraw their father’s pension money and they were left destitute. It was then that a cousin suggested starting over in Belize and Juana and her six sons, plus the wives of the two eldest and one grandchild, moved to Happy Valley. \\xa0\\nThe community was founded in March 1982 by George Price, Belize’s prime minister at the time, as a haven for refugees fleeing the civil wars that then plagued the region, especially El Salvador.\\xa0\\n“The children of refugees are now doctors, policemen, engineers or, like me, a teacher.”\\nIt initially took a few dozen families, who began cutting back the thick jungle for farmland. They received international funding implemented by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and its partners. Today, more than 600 families live in the village, says Jose Amilcar Amaya, a teacher and unofficial historian of the area.\\n“In this town, we are proud Belizeans but we are also refugees,” says Amaya, who came here with his family in 1982. “The children of refugees are now doctors, policemen, engineers or, like me, a teacher.”\\n“Valley of Peace is a wonderful example of refugee success stories,” says Andreas Wissner, UNHCR’s head of office in Belize. “It also shows how to welcome new refugees fleeing violence in the North of Central America.”\\xa0\\nThe Menendez family has felt this embrace. \\xa0\\n“I didn’t think we’d ever find a place of peace again,” says mother Juana, as chickens donated by neighbours chirp at her feet. “We knew if we stayed in El Salvador, the gang would have killed us all.”\\nFinancial support from UNHCR helped the family pay rent and buy food in their first months in Valley of Peace. They have also received support with their asylum applications from UNHCR and its implementing partner, Help For Progress.\\nJuan Barrera\\xa0rents his second home to the Menendez family for a fraction of its value.\\xa0\\n“We just hope to get our papers, find good work and then have enough money for our own land and a house.\"\\nAs part of an agricultural collective, Barrera\\xa0has helped the Menendez family get a small plot of land, where they plant corn and beans, which keeps them fed.\\nNeighbours in Valley of Peace know the Menendez boys as hard workers and they are often called upon for odd jobs.\\n“When there’s work, you can make a good living here,” says 24-year-old Alfredo, the eldest. On a good week, he and his brothers can earn up to US$90 each. In slower months, they only earn US$30 per week.\\nIn Valley of Peace, Juana’s youngest sons Juan Roberto and Ulises ride a bike to and from school, where they learn in English and Spanish and gradually integrate into this bilingual community, where English and Spanish are spoken. Juana no longer worries about her boys being alone on the streets.\\nHowever, things are not perfect. All of the Menendez brothers work without authorization since the Belizean government has yet to approve a single asylum application in recent years. Two of the brothers missed the government’s strict two-week deadline after entering the country to apply for asylum and are in limbo.\\n“We just hope to get our papers, find good work and then have enough money for our own land and a house,” says mother Juana.\\xa0\\nAnd her sons have a dream of their own: they want to help Juana get back to work again, doing what she loved.\\n“We want to earn enough to help her open her bakery again,” says Alfredo. “She has been strong for all of us so we want to do something for her.”\\n*The names of Salvadoran refugees have\\xa0been changed for protection reasons.Their new home, shared with sons Mitan and Akid, daughter-in-law Zainab, and two-year-old grand-daughter Silina, is a former children’s hostel on the edge of the lakeside city of Ioannina. The family are among the first 90 refugee residents to live at Agia Eleni, which was offered to the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, a year ago.\\nThen abandoned and in a state of disrepair, it has since been renovated thanks to European Commission funding and transformed into a self-contained model in the agency’s accommodation programme, with capacity for about 500 people.\\nThe programme is part of larger efforts aimed at ensuring that a sustainable and adequate reception system is put in place by the Greek Government, requiring the provision of more urban accommodation opportunities and improving living conditions.\\n“I will never ever forget that day.\"\\nJumaa and his family fled Syria for Lebanon in 2011, afraid that their youngest son would be forced to join the Syrian army. They lived in the neighbouring country for four years, working on farms or in fruit-packing plants. But life was tough and, after making to Turkey, they decided to make the perilous journey by boat to Europe.\\n“We had always heard that in Europe all citizens are equal in the eyes of the law,” says Jumaa. “This is something we never experienced in Syria.”\\nAfter six attempts, he and his family finally made it to the Greek island of Chios in February this year. “I will never ever forget that day,” he says. “It was as if a man who had been in the grave suddenly got a chance to step out into the world again.”\\nThe family now dream of opening a pastry shop. Jumaa and his sons know how to prepare more than 100 different types of sweet baked treats. Back in Syria, the family owned two patisseries, but “they were all stolen and also my house. There is nothing, everything was stolen,” Jumaa explains.\\nStaff from UNHCR and its NGO partner Intersos are helping them to get settled in the spacious facility, whose distinctive and attractive stone and timber buildings were designed more than half a century ago by the late Constantinos Doxiadis, a Greek architect best known for leading the team that created Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad.\\n“It was as if a man who had been in the grave suddenly got a chance to step out into the world again.”\\nAgia Eleni has living, dining and sleeping quarters, areas for indoor and outdoor activities and sports, and water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure. Families can prepare meals and access nearby shops, where they are able to buy basic provisions with cash cards issued by UNHCR under a scheme funded by the European Commission. A full range of basic services will be provided by UNHCR and partners in coordination with the Ministry of Migration Policy.\\xa0\\nJamaa and his wife, who have health problems, are now looking forward to a brighter future, and one where they can be reunited with their three other sons who had made their way earlier to Greece, where they were taken to Athens and accepted for relocation in the Netherlands.\\nTwenty-four-year-old Mitan is very grateful. “We are surrounded by such warm and friendly people,” he says, smiling. “We feel welcome and safe here.”The country did not disappoint.\\xa0In Toronto, Marta met her beloved husband, Eugene. Together, they shared a deep reverence for traditions from their homeland and the challenge of balancing those\\xa0with life in their new home country. “There are\\xa0two different identities,\" she reflects. \"You\\'re a Canadian,\\xa0but part of you is Ukrainian.”\\nWhen Eugene passed away, he opted not to have a traditional Ukrainian song played at his funeral. “He felt like Canada was his home,” says Marta.\\nToday, the walls of her house are lined with Canadian folk art, collected by her husband over the years from\\xa0his travels across the country. And Marta’s eldest son, Roman, now serves as Canada’s ambassador to Ukraine.\\n“I feel Canadian –\\xa0absolutely,” she says, 67 years after her arrival. “I\\'m staying put.”\\nNoneTonight, he is giving the keynote speech at an awards ceremony in Vienna, organized by the Association of Afghan Pupils and Students, which he helped to found. The 23-year-old science graduate, soon to start a doctorate in medical research, urges his fellow Afghan refugees: “We must dream big.”\\nHe tells the community, and his proud extended family: “I stand here because of you,”\\nApplauding in the audience are his parents – mother Rehana and father Joma Ali – and Marion Weigl and Bernhard Wimmer, an Austrian couple who effectively adopted him when he arrived as a frightened, unaccompanied minor.\\n“This is a good evening,” says Joma Ali, who was a farmer in Afghanistan, growing potatoes, fruit and vegetables in rural Ghazni province. “I am very satisfied.”\\nAs a boy, Mojtaba helped his parents in the fields. “There was no science in my childhood,” he says. “And all I knew about Austria was that there were woods.”\\n\"The scariest part was not knowing who I could trust.\"\\nThe farm was surrounded by the Taliban. The Tavakoli family was at particular risk, as they came from the persecuted Hazara minority. “Sooner or later, we were going to be attacked,” says Mojtaba. “Europe was our only hope of safety.”\\nAt the age of 13, Mojtaba and his older brother Morteza, 18, were sent ahead to Europe. Tragically, Morteza drowned on the sea crossing between Turkey and Greece, and Mojtaba was left to make the journey through the Balkans alone. “The scariest part was not knowing who I could trust,” he recalls.\\nIn Austria, he was taken into care and supported by Marion, a health care specialist, and Bernhard, an environmental scientist, who introduced him to science. “I was inspired by Charles Darwin,” says Mojtaba. “He brought me to biology.”\\nOnce he was granted asylum in Austria, Mojtaba was able to bring his Afghan family to join him, but tragedy struck the family a second time when another brother, Mustafa, 12, died of cancer in Vienna in 2014.\\nPersonal loss and gratitude for the support he has received motivate Mojtaba. “I have seen things that people twice my age have not seen,” he says. “This makes me strict with myself to use my opportunities and make my family proud.”\\nAt the ceremony, Mojtaba is receiving a certificate and a book prize from the Afghan association to mark his success in completing his BSc in molecular biology at the Medical University of Vienna. In fact, he has nearly finished his MSc in neuroscience and later this year will begin a PhD on neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease.\\n“It’s a big field and there’s little research, so it’s an up-and-coming subject,” says Mojtaba, who had considered doing further study in Scotland, a centre for neuroscience. Instead, a Marie Curie scholarship from the European Union will allow him to study in Austria, at the Institute of Science and Technology in Klosterneuburg.\\nNone\\nThis means he will stay close to his parents, three sisters and one brother. The younger ones are still in school but the oldest girl, Sohela, 21, is receiving a school leaver’s prize at the ceremony and the association’s best wishes as she heads off to university to study physics.\\nNone\\nAnother member of the audience, Reihana Mohammadi, 18, says she was there to support her brother. “He’s going to university to do economics. He’s a role model for me. This gives me something to work for.”\\nSoraya Auhadi, 19, beams as she comes off stage, clutching a certificate for finishing school, and has permission from the Vienna Chamber of Commerce to open a restaurant. “I took a three-month course in accounting, hygiene, customer service and labour rights and now I can employ others in my business,” she says.\\nAll the students are aiming high but, in his address, Mojtaba urges them to “dream even bigger”.\\nA slight, bespectacled figure, he speaks in fluent German. He does not mince his words about the difficulties refugees face in integrating into Austrian society. He calls on fellow Afghans to take an interest in politics and not to be passive in their new homeland.\\n“I have a dream,” he concludes, “that one day an Austrian government minister will have Afghan roots, and that someone from our community will win a Nobel Prize.”\\nThe hall resounds to thunderous applause.In 1972, under orders from then President Idi Amin, all Ugandans of Asian descent were required to leave the country within 90 days. Sameena’s parents were determined to ensure that she and her brother, Naeem, were able to live a carefree childhood.\\nExpelled from their home amid flaring tensions, the young family were among more than 7,000 Ugandan Asians who sought refuge – and a new life – in Canada.\\nWith Air Canada planes sent to airlift refugees, they were on the first, well-publicized flight out of Uganda. It was Sameena’s first time on an aircraft and, after they landed in Montreal and were processed by Canadian officials, she remembers eating Indian food that had been prepared by their new hosts.\\n“I don\\'t ever remember home not being a happy, positive place.\"\\nA government logbook records the arrival of father Mohamed Ali, mother Zarina, Naeem and Sameena. With them, they brought seven suitcases.\\n“It\\'s funny what we packed,” says Sameena. “My mom didn\\'t know what to pack, so she packed pots and cutlery. You don\\'t know what you\\'re going to need.”\\nIn Uganda, both her parents had worked as teachers. But in Canada, those credentials were not recognized, so they took whatever jobs they could find. “That probably was tough for them,” she says.\\nShe watched as, uprooted from their home and resettled to a foreign country and culture, her parents struggled to maintain the appearance of calm and order in their new home, masking the uncertainty that loomed over them.\\nIn 1972, Sameena Merchant family fled Uganda for Canada (Annie Sakkab, camera) \\nOne summer, she decided to set her sights on medical school. “I never felt that my desire to succeed and excel should be something I should hide,” she says. “This country gave me the opportunity to do whatever I wanted – all I had to do was make the commitment and do the work.”\\nYears later, having successfully obtained a medical degree, Sameena moved west to Calgary and met her future husband, Shamez. Like her, he had also fled Uganda as a child and found sanctuary in Canada. They bought their ‘forever home’ together, where they raised two children.\\nIt was not long before the rest of the Merchant family followed and, today, her parents live up the street. Meanwhile, Naeem’s family is only a short drive away. Sameena’s house has become a meeting point where three generations converge for raucous weekend lunches.\\nWhile the personal life she has built has blossomed, so too has her professional life. Merchant’s family practice, spanning almost three decades, has had a lasting impact on the Calgary community, earning her a nomination of Calgary Family Physician of the Year.\\n“As a family physician, you\\'re really a witness into people\\'s lives,” says Sameena. “I feel really privileged that I have been able to make an impact.” There is a joy, she adds, in watching the patients you knew as children later become parents.\\nWith a tenderness born of medicine and love, Sameena guides her father as he searches for his favourite chair in her house. Over the years, glaucoma has stolen his sight, making it difficult for him to continue his watercolour painting. Her mother heats up curries and corn in a peanut sauce – recipes dating back to their life in Uganda. Grandchildren race around them. “I think as a parent now, I realise actually how much they did,” she says.\\nNow, after all her parents did to shelter their children from fear, it is Sameena and her sibling\\xa0who care for them, helping the parents enjoy the life – and home – they all built together.\\n“If someone were to ask me, who my heroes are, I would say my parents,” she concludes.\\nNoneRestaurants in Greece, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands opened their kitchens to 80 refugee chefs of 25 different nationalities, allowing them to showcase their skills and share their culinary culture.\\nSyrian cook Mohammad Elkhaldi donned his chef’s whites to launch this year’s festival on June 15 in the restaurant Le Substrat, owned by award-winning French chef Hubert Vergoin in France’s gastronomic capital, Lyon.\\nThe final dishes were served on June 30 at the Ethnos restaurant in the Florentine neighbourhood of Borgo San Lorenzo, where Ethiopian cook Unatu Tagi and Michelin-starred chef Marco Stabile took over the kitchen.\\n2017 Refugee Food Festival\\nIn total, more than10,000 diners enjoyed food from countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Cameroon, in surroundings ranging from smart dining rooms to bistros and take-aways. Customers were offered treats from cocktails and ice creams to five-course gastronomic dinners.\\nThe French-born initiative started last year as a partnership between the NGO Food Sweet Food and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, with the support of partners, citizens, local authorities, restaurants and private businesses.\\n“A high point for me was seeing the smiles on the chefs\\' faces as they answered questions from customers.”\\nAfter last year’s successful events in Paris and Strasbourg, for its second year the festival was extended to other European cities, and talks have already begun on proposals to hold Refugee Food Festivals next year in cities in the United States, Canada, Brazil and Australia.\\nOne of the organizers, Louis Martin, co-founder of Food Sweet Food with Marine Mandrila, said this year’s festival may be over, but the project was still in its early stages. “There is so much more to do, starting with following up the professional integration of the chefs,” he said.\\nHere are some of the highlights of the 2017 Refugee Food Festival:\\nNone\\n“Refugees are people with skills and talents and it is vital that they are offered the right opportunities to fulfil their potential,” said owner Thanassis Vassilenas.\\nPhilippe Leclerc, UNHCR Representative in Greece, said: “The refugee food festival was a true eye-opener for refugees as well as for the Athenian restaurant owners and chefs who hosted them.”\\nNone\\n“I found this initiative amazing. I believe that Spain needs this type of events to support refugees,” said Banafsheh Farhang, the owner of one of the participating restaurants, Banibanoo.\\nNatalia Diaz, co-organizer of the Madrid section of the festival, said: “A high point for me was seeing the smiles on the faces of the refugee chefs as they answered questions from restaurant customers who were genuinely interested in their cuisine.”\\n\\xa0\\nNone\\nThe sous-chef of De Balie, Luis Duarte Borges, said: “It’s a pleasure to have Mohammed here with us.

She was lucky to get a job at the Stitch by Stitch workshop, an enterprise launched by two local designers with the aim of producing clothes for small German labels.\\nThe all-women workshop, founded by fashion designer Claudia Frick and graphic designer Nicole von Alvensleben, employs six refugees and one German seamstress. It is a win-win situation for the refugees, who need jobs, and the workshop, which needs staff.\\n“We are giving them a platform to show their skills,” says Nicole. “Companies often have difficulties hiring people. They [the refugees] come from societies where handicrafts and other trades are still alive, and they want to do them.”\\n“There is a sisterly atmosphere here.\"\\nReyhane had been in Germany for six months when Nicole and Claudia met her at a charity event. Reyhane was wearing a jacket that she had made herself. “It had a well-made collar and pockets,” says Claudia. “I said, ‘oh my God, she must be good if she has made that herself.\\'\" With that, Reyhane was hired.\\nDoing everything from sewing on buttons to complicated tailoring, the women work for €9 an hour – 16 cents above Germany\\'s minimum wage. “We pay ourselves the same as the staff,” says Nicole. “This is not a sweatshop.”\\n“There is a sisterly atmosphere here,” says Claudia. “We talk about everything.\"\\nOn display is a cute black dress with a colourful pattern, commissioned by Heike Merkle, the owner of the independent Frankfurt label Death by Dress.\\nNone\\nInto this industry have walked skilled refugees with fashion experience in their home countries.\\nBefore the war in Syria, Iman Khatibe, 40, had her own workshop in Aleppo, where she mainly made wedding and evening dresses, as well as lingerie, all with elaborate embroidery. “I learnt from my grandmother and aunt and uncle, who were all in the fashion design business,” she says.\\nNow she sees potential in mixing European and Middle Eastern styles. “I get some ideas from magazines,” she says, “but I don’t copy what I see on the street. My inspiration comes from inside.”\\nIman leaves work early because she has a new baby at home. The younger seamstresses work on through the hot afternoon.\\nEsraa Ali, 21, from Damascus, is a trainee, learning the techniques of sewing. Two days a week, she goes to school and is quickly picking up German.\\n“My mother taught me about matching colours… My father taught me how to use the sewing machine.”\\nAlthough Esraa liked the traditional long coats and robes that women wore back home in Syria, she was inspired most of all by the Disney film \\'Cinderella\\'. “I had never seen such pretty dresses, with tiny, nipped-in waists, and the open hair,” she says.\\nEsraa designed, sewed and modelled her own dress for a tailoring a competition in Frankfurt. The theme was the Roaring Twenties, so she added grey lace and black pearls to her rose-pink dress and matching hijab. “It was a sort of Syrian roaring twenties,” she laughs.\\nAt the next table, still working with the lace for her delicate suit, Reyhane recalls how she was her own boss and had her own small business in the Iranian city of Mashhad.\\nShe came from a long line of tailors, originally from Herat in Afghanistan. “My mother taught me about matching colours,” she says. “My father taught me how to use the sewing machine.”\\nWorking from home, she made clothes for Afghan and Iranian clients. “I miss the textiles there,” she says, “the colours, the patterns, the Afghan carpets made by hand.”\\nReyhane likes to mix Afghan and European styles. She wears jeans, even short skirts with leggings, and always the hijab, “because I like it”. She is ambitious and hopes to design her own clothes and have her own shop in Frankfurt.\\nAfter the upheaval of leaving Iran, Reyhane has picked up the threads of her profession in Germany. “Step by step, stitch by stitch,” she says. “You could say I am stitching my life together again. Yes, that’s how it feels.”“You could open a store in Kensington Market and it didn\\'t really matter where you came from,” Tom recalls. “Didn\\'t matter what language you spoke, didn\\'t matter what colour, what religion. All you had to do was prove yourself.”\\nThe market has long served as a starting point for the displaced. Tom’s father, William Mihalik, set up his suit store there after fleeing the Hungarian uprising in 1956. For 12 years, the family were forced to live apart.\\n\"All you had to do was prove yourself.”\\nIn his absence, William was a powerful figure in his son’s imagination – informed by the gossip and stories Tom heard from friends and family.\\n“Everyone in Hungary said: ‘Tommy you\\'re going to the land of honey and milk!’” he says, laughing. The details were scarce – all he knew was William owned a store selling clothing and furniture – but he filled in the gaps with youthful fantasy.\\nTom recalls the excitement of his first visit to his father’s store in downtown Toronto.\\nBut, as they passed by William’s shop, its windows protected by thick iron bars, Tom’s heart sank. “It was a gloomy night… my dad pointed out where our store was. He was very proud of it. It was not what I imagined. I imagined something grandiose.”\\nFifty years ago, Tom fled Hungary and found sanctuary in Canada (Annie Sakkab, camera)\\nBefore and after school, Tom worked at the shop. It soon became an obsession. In time, it expanded and moved down the street, still remaining in Kensington Market.\\nAfter he bought the business from his father in 1987, Tom quickly learned how close-knit the area was. The cost of staffing and overheads overwhelmed the trickle of money flowing into the coffers, leaving him unable to pay rent.\\n“I went to my neighbour and I asked if she could lend me eight hundred dollars, and she immediately said, \\'Tom, it would be our pleasure,’” he says. “It shows you how strong the community was. Without even blinking an eye, she lent me the money.”\\nTom’s brush with insolvency confirmed what he has learned over the years – community matters.\\n“When you come to a community like Kensington Market, when you came from nothing – totally nothing, and you’re the weakest link – where you prosper, you have to give some of that money back. You have to. It\\'s your responsibility to give back to the community.”\\nSince the Mihaliks arrived \\xa0in the 1950s and 1960s, the market\\xa0has also hosted the businesses of refugee entrepreneurs from Somalia, Ethiopia and Vietnam.\\nThe market has changed dramatically over time – grocery and appliance stores have been replaced by cafes and clothing outlets. But Tom’s store has remained largely unchanged, cementing his status as a fixture of the neighbourhood.\\nIn the back of Tom\\'s\\xa0shop, a row of tailors work meticulously on heaps of clothing, representing the legacy of the market. Tran Duc Tu, who fled Vietnam as a refugee in 1977, has worked with Tom for 15 years.\\nDuring this time, Tom has received many awards and commendations for his contributions to charities, hospitals and people down on their luck.\\n\"It\\'s your responsibility to give back to the community.”\\n“We have a responsibility as Canadians to make sure we also give back to this great country. Not only do we just take – we also have to give back,” he says. “It\\'s really what you put in – as a Canadian. You will see it in your children and your grandchildren.”\\nHe credits much of the store’s success not to his business acumen, but the steadfast support of his family. “My sister has been here in the store since she was 12, 13, 14 years old,” he says. “My mom, until her death, never missed a day.”\\nTom’s son, Tom Jr., now runs a recently-opened second branch in the heart of Toronto’s financial district. While the well-stocked shops there looks nothing like the first shop opened by William in his early days in Canada, the current form remains loyal to its origins.\\n“We really, really put in a lot of work to get where we are today,” says Tom, surveying the rows suits in the quiet of the shop after hours. “Hopefully we can still continue to work another 60 years.”\\nNoneIn 1980, brothers Trung and John joined the waves of people fleeing persecution in Viet Nam, slipping away from Saigon one night in a small wooden boat with 59 others. In fleeing, they left behind family, friends and the home they had known all their lives. Trung left with nothing but a black leather satchel – a prize from elementary school. Inside, he stuffed sketches and watercolour paintings.\\n“I left behind my girlfriend,” Trung says. “I still remember the tears on her face when I told her I was leaving. I’ll never forget that.”\\n\"I still remember the tears on her face when I told her I was leaving.\"\\nTrung was among nearly 800,000 Vietnamese who crammed aboard boats and ships to flee repression after the fall of Saigon in 1975.\\nHis boat was headed for Thailand, but after seven days on choppy seas, it began to drift off course and was intercepted by a large fishing boat, whose crew tried to return it to Viet Nam. But terrified of reprisals, the passengers rose up, commandeering the larger vessel and resuming their voyage.\\nArtist Trung draws on his experience as a refugee  (Annie Sakkab, camera) \\nAfter reaching Thailand, Trung lived in the sticky heat of a refugee camp. Each month he received money from Long, his older brother who was studying in Japan\\xa0and wanted to support his creative talents.\\n“Trung, he\\'s an artist,” says John. “So he used that money to buy papers, watercolours and brushes.”\\nThe young painter used the materials to document life in the camp, sketching his impressions onto pages with black ink as he awaited resettlement to Canada as a refugee, with his brother.\\nNow, 37 years later, he still keeps those pages in the house he built for himself surrounded by rolling fields near Owen Sound, in southern Ontario.\\nThe weighty quiet of his home in the country suits him, he says. A porch extends from the back of the house, overlooking acreage of thickets, trees and water. In the living room, the satchel, a relic of his early years in Viet Nam, sits in a glass case.\\nThe home is far removed from the Thai refugee camp and Toronto, where Trung spent his early, hectic days in Canada. But no matter how far he physically moves from the journey, it never leaves him. His most recent sculpture, a cracked wooden boat with a family of three slamming up against the waves, is a tribute to journeys similar to his. According to some estimates, just half of all families who made that trip survived.\\nCanada has given him the refuge he needed to focus on his work, he says. His paintings and sculptures have been displayed in some of the country’s most prestigious institutions.\\nIn tribute to the nation that welcomed and resettled him and his siblings, Trung created busts of 10 famous Canadians, including then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and environmental advocate David Suzuki.\\n“When you die you are buried,” says Trung. “But the soul – the spirit – is still alive. I want to make sculptures that we can look at, so people can remember any day, any time. It lasts forever.”\\n\"I want to make sculptures… so people can remember any day, any time. It lasts forever.”\\nInside the exposed pine ribs of Trung’s studio, a dusty haze of plaster settles over the large busts congregated around his table. The diversity of his subjects is testament to his passion and vision – a former Canadian prime minister rests opposite Vietnamese generals. On the far edge of one row, Trung’s late mother watches over his work.\\nThe City of Mississauga, near Toronto, is currently working with Trung to cast a large statue in commemoration of the many Vietnamese residents now living in the area.\\n“Younger Canadians don\\'t understand why our people came to Canada,” says Trung. “But now, this figure – this statue – will show them the boat that carried the Vietnamese to freedom.”\\nHe hopes his work conveys the tragedy, as well as the dreams of those who fled Viet Nam.\\n“Artists, they have their special soul,” says John. “His expression is through art – sculpting and painting. That\\'s his life. And he will continue to do that until his last days.”\\nNone“My family traces its lineage back to coming over on the Mayflower,” said Miranda Kaiser, great, great granddaughter of Rockefeller Sr., referring to the ship that carried the first Pilgrims – refugees fleeing persecution in Europe who laid the foundations of the United States – to the “New World” in 1620. “I think that this country would never have become what it has become today if there hadn’t been this mix of cultures and peoples from many places around the world.”\\nAs Miranda and generations of Rockefellers grew up frolicking in the gardens of the Kykuit estate, elders of the dynasty were directing their storied fortunes, hearts and minds towards making sure that refugees from around the world found safety, compassion and opportunity in the land the Rockefellers helped build. And in the process they have helped set the American standard for welcoming the vulnerable stranger.\\nThe Rockefeller\\n“There’s been a long tradition for support for refugees around the world starting in World War I up to current time which is particularly interesting to me given my current line of work where I’m the co-president of the Refugee Center Online,” Miranda explained to UNHCR in conversations at Kykuit.\\nNone\\n“I remember being able to tell my grandfather about it and how excited he was about the work,” she said, referring to David Rockefeller. “He, of course being the older generation, wasn’t as familiar with the technology. But the ideas were old and familiar to him of welcoming and trying to help people establish themselves on their own merit.”\\nMiranda recounts how at the age of 101 her grandfather pledged two years of financial support for the Refugee Center Online. “He was very long thinking,” she smiled as she reminisced. “Just as he was about to turn 102, I had dinner with him. He said that he would authorize the check to go out. It must have been one of the last philanthropic gifts that he authorized and the day that he died (March 20, 2017) was the day that the organization received the check.”\\nKaiser intentionally selected the Rockefeller estate in New York this year as the site for the organization’s strategic planning retreat for its board of directors – of which half are refugees. Attendees included people like Naser Yahya, 38, who said his family fought against ISIS in Northern Iraq making it necessary for him to flee Erbil. Today, PhD in hand and a father to three including one-year old twins, he has created a new life in the Midwest.\\nThen there is Mohy Omer, 33, from Sudan who fled first to Kenya for a little over a year and was then resettled in Fargo, North Dakota. “It was really scary and it was hopeful,” he said, recalling his resettlement experience. “I didn’t know a single person. It’s extremely cold. A lot of people did not look like me and of course speak like me.”\\nBut the Fargo community made clear to Mohy that he was welcome with them – and Mohy more than rose to the occasion. He taught himself English, put himself through university, and afterward impressed North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp enough to hire him to work as an intern in her Capitol Hill office. Since then he has met President Obama – twice – works for the United States Institute of Peace and dreams of working in the national security establishment one day.\\nMiranda Kaiser, Co-President of Refugee Center Online talks with Naser Yahya, a member of the advisory board who is a refugee from Iraq, and Mohy Omer (far right), who is Vice Chair of Refugee Center Online and a refugee from Sudan. Miranda is taking them and other board and staff members of the Refugee Center Online on a walk through Rockefeller Estate during the Center\\'s annual meeting there. Miranda\\'s great, great grandfather is John D. Rockefeller.\\xa0 ©\\xa0Lucian Perkins\\nKaiser explained that both as a human being in general and as a Rockefeller in particular she feels a strong calling to help ensure that the compassion, opportunity and safety that are so deeply woven into the fabric of the traditional American response to refugees are preserved and strengthened.\\n“I think particularly right now, when a lot of refugees who are already here are very afraid of what is happening and refugees who are waiting to come into the country are afraid. My family felt it important to show that we as the Rockefeller family continue to welcome refugees and always will.\\n“There is a myth these days of ‘perfect security,’” Kaiser continued. “You know so much of our humanity and our country, and our culture is tied up in refugees and immigrants coming here and being a part of our society. If we’re going to close the door on them we are going to give up a lot.”“Where will you be tomorrow?” he asks the students, sitting at desks in a room decorated with world maps. “In class!” they respond. “Will you be studying or will you be playing around?” he asks. “Studying!” comes the reply in a chorus of laughter.\\nBienvenido’s name means “welcome” in Spanish, and his gentle rapport strikes a chord with the Syrian children in his class, who fled their country’s civil war alone.\\n“He’s not like a teacher, he’s like a father with his son,” says 16-year-old Mahmud*, who fled the slaughter and chaos in Aleppo alone. “He’s always laughing, talking and making jokes. He’s great.”\\nThe regional government of Andalusia last year became the first in Spain to host unaccompanied Syrian refugee children such as Mahmud. Since September, it has welcomed eight youngsters aged 15 to 17 – six boys and two girls – all relocated from Greece.\\nThe aim was to provide a safe, nurturing environment in a residential setting with social, health, education and culture and leisure resources designed to “favour their social development” and help them feel integrated.\\n“Our task is to support them in an environment where they feel safe.”\\nChatting under the protective eye of a care worker at their residential home in Motril, a group of the youngsters spoke of fleeing fighting, murder, forced recruitment and desperate poverty at home, dodging armed fighters to slip into Turkey.\\nCrammed into overcrowded dinghies, they reached Greece, where some roughed it in tents at a chaotic camp near the border with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\\n“It was very, very, very bad,” Mahmud recalls. “People robbed, killed, did bad things to the girls. Lots of bad things … It’s not a place for children … Sometimes we would sleep hungry.”\\nUnaccompanied minors from Syria who were relocated to Motril, Spain.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Susan Hopper\\nNow they live at a group home in a quiet backstreet where the loudest sound is a trilling canary. The youngsters share spotless rooms, sit together for meals and attend secondary schools, in a project run by the regional government of Andalusia and supported by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.\\n“Our task is to support them in an environment where they feel safe, to enable their social development and help them feel integrated,” says Margarita de la Rasilla, a UNHCR legal officer in Spain.\\nThe children are offered after-school activities as part of the effort to integrate them into the town of 60,000 inhabitants south of the provincial capital, Granada. These range from Spanish evening classes at the Club UNESCO Motril, where Bienvenido teaches, to work experience and volunteering.\\n“We’re completely delighted with them, and hope they never leave!”\\nTareq, 17, from the Syrian capital, Damascus, is doing work experience at a local restaurant. Donning a black apron, chef’s hat and a tie, he heads into the gleaming kitchen to prepare locally sourced produce. Initially not too keen on the Spanish diet rich in fish, he says he is starting to like the food and is widening his circle of friends.\\n“It’s been good… I’ve met a lot of people here,” he says. “Both at school and in the restaurant. Little by little I learned a lot.”\\nFor restaurant manager Alvaro Garcia, having the conscientious, well-spoken youngster on the team has been a good experience and one that he believes other local employers should try.\\n“People might think that it will bring problems, but it’s been quite the opposite,” he says, sitting at a table set with a white tablecloth in the cool interior of the restaurant. “They come to learn, not to be a bother. It’s been very positive.”\\nYlias, a 16-year-old who fled war-ravaged Qamishli with his younger sister, now volunteers once a week at CONECTA, a local non-profit organization bringing children with autism together with youngsters of their own age. He recalls how he struggled to express himself when he first arrived in Motril, and looked for ways to bond with Juan, a teenager who lives with non-verbal autism.\\n“I felt some empathy for him,” Ylias explains. “I communicated using my hands and my eyes.”\\nNow, he says, the weekly social event held in a building behind the town’s small port, is “the best thing I do.” Amid the hubbub and chatter, he and Juan shoot basketball with other children or sit side-by-side buttering bread at a “merienda” or snack break.\\nFor the founder and president of CONECTA, Elisa Salamanca, seeing the children interact with Ylias and another young Syrian volunteer is a joy.\\n“They’re friendly, very proactive and super affectionate with (the kids), and they bring a lot of happiness,” she says with a broad smile. “We’re completely delighted with them, and hope they never leave!”\\n\"I can study and do my things like everyone else. For me, that’s enough.\"\\nIn 2016, Andalusian authorities made 24 places available for unaccompanied Syrian child asylum-seekers, and looks forward to welcoming a further 16.\\nUNHCR has urged states to increase the pace of relocation for eligible asylum-seekers in Italy and Greece, including unaccompanied children.\\nUNHCR has been contacted by other regional governments interested in following suit, including Catalunya, Cantabria and the Basque country and has been providing specialist training to partners preparing to host them.\\nAt first, some of the children in the pilot project struggled to adjust to life in provincial Spain, unhappy with the unfamiliar food and the loss of independence. However, de la Rasilla says, “you can see, little by little, how they are changing their minds and seeing the opportunities that they have”.\\nAll the children interviewed said they had, in different ways, come to like their new lives. “At first I didn’t like anything, I didn’t want to live here,” says Mahmud.\\n“I didn’t like the house, I didn’t like anyone, but now everything is perfect. There’s food, there’s water, I can take showers, sleep and look for a job. I can study and do my things like everyone else.

At that time, when I saw my community going through unbearable suffering, I had lost all hope for the future.”\\nShe is not alone. Most refugees in Mauritania have missed years of school and struggle to acquire an education, particularly at higher level, and many face a language barrier or lack the funds to support themselves during their studies.\\nNone\\nFatimetou’s journey was fraught with difficulties. She and her family were taken to Mbera refugee camp, temporary home for more than 50,000 Malian refugees. Almost half its nomadic population are illiterate and less than one percent – hardly any of them girls -- make it past the final year of secondary school.\\n\"At first, my mother did not want me to study,” Fatimetou said. “She would have liked me to stop after primary school, because she thought that level was enough for me to learn at least how to speak French and then come back to stay at home with her, that\\'s what she wanted.”\\nHer mother feared that leaving home might expose her to violence, telling her: “If you leave my home, I do not know what will happen to you.”\\n\"Girls’ attendance drops drastically when we look at secondary school figures.\"\\nMany girls whose parents are illiterate, like Fatimetou’s mother and father, grow up believing that education may not be suitable for them.\\nUNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and other humanitarian organisations have been pressing for the inclusion of girls in education in Mbera camp.\\n“As a result of these continued sensitization efforts in Mbera, the percentage of girls enrolled in the six primary schools of the camp is now almost equal to that of boys,” said Nabil Othman, UNHCR Representative in Mauritania.\\n“However, girls’ attendance drops drastically when we look at secondary school figures, representing only 27 percent of students. In the fifth year of the Mali crisis, we can no longer afford the loss of new generations.”\\nFatimetou feels relieved after finishing her first English exam at Noaukchott University.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Helena Pes\\nHundreds of thousands of people in Mali fled their homes after clashes between armed rebels and government forces erupted in early 2012. \\xa0For Fatimetou, life took an unexpected turn when she found herself in the camp with her family.\\n“In the crisis of 2012, I lost a cousin and other family members,” she said. She and her family fled first to the Mauritanian border town of Fassala and were taken to Mbera camp in a convoy. “Every one of us had witnessed unbearable suffering,” she said.\\n“As soon as I got into the camp, I felt I had to do everything in my power to help people. I am a daughter of this community and felt it was only natural for me to do something to alleviate their suffering.”\\nShe could speak French and she set about helping Malians to understand the procedures in the camp.\\n“Thanks to this experience of the camp I developed more self-confidence.”\\nNone\\n“By the time I was 16, I could do things that other girls couldn’t do,” she said. “I was able to make people understand things, explain to them how to register as refugees and make them understand their rights.\\n“This made me understand the power of language and it also convinced my mother to embrace the advantages of education.” Fatimetou explained.\\n“Thanks to this experience of the camp I developed more self-confidence. It motivated me to go ahead and continue my studies.”\\nFatimetou completed her baccalaureate in Mbera camp, which allowed her to compete for the DAFI scholarship.\\nShe is among a small number who took on the challenge of studying English in the Arabic- and French-speaking country.\\nEnglish is not taught at school in Mbera camp, which follows the Malian curriculum, so refugees from Mali have no basic knowledge of the language and must start from scratch, which discourages most of the candidates.\\n“I chose English because it is the first language in the world,” Fatimetou said. “It will allow me to communicate with many people and I love communication.\\n“The most important thing to me is to help my community. I want to be able to talk about the reality we experience to the world and I know that learning English will help me do that. It will also help me to understand the world and discover things that are different, new and interesting ways of living.”By sunset, a crowd has gathered to hear readings by Syrian and Levantine poets with accompanying German translations. It is\\xa0standing room only. The event is typical of those hosted by Baynetna, or “Between Us”, Berlin’s newest library, offering literature in Arabic, German and English.\\nThe library is the brainchild of Muhannad, a Syrian student who runs it with an international team of academics, writers and publishers. “There are many writers, authors, musicians coming to Berlin,” says Muhannad, 30. “They need this stage, a place to introduce their work.”\\nA former student of English literature, he had to abandon his own library when he fled his home in Aleppo in 2013. The loss of his books weighed heavy on him during the years he scraped a living in Lebanon and Turkey.\\n“I didn’t have a single book in my hand at that time,” he says. “But studying was always in my mind, because I missed it so much. In Syria, I bought the books to read and make my own library, my own education.”\\n“If there’s such thing as integration, that’s it. You learn from me, I learn from you.”\\nMuhannad left Turkey in 2015 and set off across the Mediterranean Sea to Greece. Soon, he found himself waiting in a shelter in southern Germany for his asylum application to be processed, bored and craving a good read.\\n“It’s horrible to lose everything,” he says. “But it’s not just the need of food or money, there are the needs of the mind. You need your culture, your books.”\\nBefore long, Muhannad struck up an online friendship with a Berlin-based literary scholar and newspaper editor, Ines Kappert. She asked him what she could give him to help him pass the time in the shelter.\\nWhat he really wanted, he said, was access to an Arabic library. However, Ines told him she did not know of any in the country. “That stayed in my mind,” he says. Muhannad moved to Berlin and won a scholarship to study at a liberal arts college. However, something was still missing.\\nTogether, Ines and Muhannad discussed the idea of creating a library, a space to showcase Arabic-language literature. Before long they found a venue –\\xa0the top floor of a former high-rise hotel now used as accommodation for families from Syria and Iraq.\\nThen they set about filling the shelves with donated books on politics, religion, history and science, in Arabic but also in German and English. “The library is for everybody –\\xa0it’s an exchange of culture,” says Muhannad. “We can learn from each other, it’s not just one side. If there’s such thing as integration, that’s it. You learn from me, I learn from you.”\\nSince it opened in February, the library has won support from a wide range of literary and cultural groups. Muhannad and Ines were joined by Jordanian student Dana Haddad, Syrian publisher Maher Khwis and Syrian musician Ali Hasan. The team opens the library four days a week for browsing, discussion and research. At night, regular events showcase authors from Berlin’s blossoming Arabic-language literary scene.\\n“Lots of people they feel they are home now here, because it’s their culture, their people and their discussions,” says Muhannad. “We fill that gap.”GENEVA –\\xa0Chefs, muralists, cyclists and even a pop-up orchestra\\xa0led millions of people around the world\\xa0in celebratory events to mark World Refugee Day, at a time when the number of men, women and children uprooted by wars and persecution has broken records.\\nNone\\nsign the petition\\n\\xa0\\nWashington D.C., USA\\nSinger Thao Nguyen gives a\\xa0free concert at The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

He and his mother, Odette, and 13-year-old sister, Mariam, moved from across town after Odette fell ill and the church offered them the spot.\\nThe family fled the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2011. For five years, they lived in Kenya, waiting to be vetted and resettled, before finally traveling to the United States to start a new life in North Carolina.\\nIt took months of dialogue and generous donations from the community to make Hope House happen. When it did, a local contractor lent his expertise and a carpenter built bunk beds for the children.\\nIn March 2017, Hope House finally became a home. The facility will serve as a way station for refugees who are resettled to North Carolina but struggle to find a long-term family home.\\n\"I preached … about what I see as the biblical call to welcome the stranger, to be a neighbor to people.\"\\nAlthough it is only temporary, Hope House gives the Hertier family the chance to make new friends and integrate. Jacqueline Allen, a local retiree, works with Odette on her English twice a week. Cara Bolton, who helped Pastor Bigger convince others to create Hope House, often hangs out with John, Mariam and Odette. “Just last week we had a pizza party, danced and talked,” she says.\\n“We had conversations with folks who were convinced refugees were coming to take over our way of life,” Bigger says. “We had about a four- or five-month discussion and discernment and even prayer process. I preached, not regularly but several times, about what I see as the biblical call to welcome the stranger, to be a neighbor to people, no matter what their backgrounds. I have told them that refugees are not causing danger but they are escaping fear and that they are the ones at risk.”\\nBigger says the world’s growing refugee crisis requires action. “My conviction is that the church needs to be involved,” he concludes. “People will say to me: ‘Shouldn’t we take care of our own?’ I say: ‘It is not an either-or, but a both-and.’”None\\nIt noted that the pace at which people are becoming displaced remains very high. On average, 20 people were driven from their homes every minute last year, or one every three seconds – less than the time it takes to read this sentence.\\n“By any measure this is an unacceptable number.\"\\nUN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi\\n“It speaks louder than ever to the need for solidarity and common purpose in preventing and resolving crises, and ensuring together that the world’s refugees, internally displaced and asylum-seekers are properly protected and cared for while solutions are pursued.”\\nUNHCR Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2016\\nIn each of the past five years, annual increases to the global displacement total have been in the millions. While the 2016 total is high – representing an enormous number of people needing protection worldwide – it also shows that growth in displacement slowed last year.\\nThe total figure includes 40.3 million people uprooted within the borders of their own countries, about 500,000 fewer than in 2015. Meanwhile, the total number seeking asylum globally was 2.8 million, about 400,000 fewer than in the previous year.\\nHowever, the total seeking safety across international borders as refugees topped 22.5 million, the highest number seen since UNHCR was founded in 1950 in the aftermath of the Second World War.\\n“My husband was killed in the war ... which\\xa0made me decide\\xa0to leave my home, everything, behind.”\\nThe conflict in Syria, now in its seventh year, was the world’s biggest producer of refugees (5.5 million). However in 2016 the biggest new factor was South Sudan, where the disastrous break-off of peace efforts in July of that year contributed to an outflow of 737,400 people by the end of the year. That number has continued to rise during the first half of 2017.\\nNyawet Tut, a South Sudanese mother of five in her 30s, described how soldiers set fire to her village and she had to run for her life with her own five children and five others of relatives killed in the conflict.\\n“My husband was killed in\\xa0the war which, in addition to the shortage of food, made me decide\\xa0to leave my home, everything, behind,” she told UNHCR\\xa0staff during an interview at a temporary way station in Ethiopia.\\nIn terms of overall displacement, Syria still accounts for the biggest numbers, with 12 million people (65 per cent of the population) displaced internally or living outside the country as refugees.\\nLeaving aside the long-standing Palestinian refugee situation, Colombians (7.7 million) and Afghans (4.7 million) remained the second- and third-largest displaced populations, followed by Iraqis (4.2 million). In total, about 3.3 million South Sudanese had fled their homes by the end of the year, in what has become the fastest-growing displacement of people in the world.\\nParticularly heartbreaking is the plight of children, who make up half the world’s refugees, and continue to bear a disproportionate burden of the suffering, mainly because of their heightened vulnerability.\\nTragically, 75,000 asylum claims were received from children travelling alone or separated from their parents, among them youngsters like Tareq,\\xa016, who dodged armed combatants to walk out of Syria into neighbouring Turkey.\\n“There was no future where we lived,” he told UNHCR. “There was no university and no work. There were troops grabbing young children like me, and they send them to war, and they get killed. I wanted to study.”\\nLast year, much of the news coverage focused on refugee resettlement to developed countries, including efforts by some states to restrict access and even erect border barriers.\\nHowever, figures in the report showed that, worldwide, most refugees – 84 per cent – were in developing or middle-income countries at the end of 2016, with one in every three (4.9 million people) being hosted by the world’s least developed countries.\\n\"There were troops grabbing young children like me ... I wanted to study.”\\nThis huge imbalance reflects several things including the lack of consensus internationally when it comes to hosting refugees, and the proximity of many poor countries to regions of conflict.\\nIt also illustrates the need for countries and communities supporting refugees and other displaced people to be properly resourced and supported, the absence of which can cause instability, have consequences for life-saving humanitarian work or lead to secondary displacement.\\nUNHCR estimates that at least 10 million people were without a nationality or at risk of statelessness at the end of 2016. However, data recorded by governments and communicated to UNHCR were limited to 3.2 million stateless people in 75 countries.\\nFaced with another year of a record displacement, devastating the lives of millions of men, women and children, one thing is clear: “We have to do better for these people,” Grandi said. “For a world in conflict, what is needed is determination and courage, not fear.”\\n(Additional reporting by Diana Diaz in Ethiopia)Mykola Ivanovych, who worked as a bus driver for 54 years, must present himself at the state-run bank in Stanytsia Luhanska, which checks his identity to allow him to receive his monthly payment of USD$53.\\nInside the bank, he waits patiently while his wife joins the queue to carry out the verification process.\\nMykola Ivanovych, who is his 70s, suffered two strokes after his son was killed by an artillery shell in 2014 –\\xa0the first year of the Ukraine conflict, which has cost nearly 10,000 lives.\\n“Pensions are an acquired right of all citizens and should not be connected to their IDP registration.”\\nFor hundreds of thousands of elderly and disabled people in the conflict-torn Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, the state pension is their only means of support.

Others attribute it to the country’s roots in Catholic, Jewish and Muslim cultures, which has contributed to a deep sense of cultural tolerance.\\nIn a sign of the strength of support for refugees in Spain, Rescate’s befriending programme has been swamped by applications from would-be mentors, with 230 expressions of interest of whom 90 have been selected.\\n“The take-up has been tremendous, overwhelming,” says Mayra Garcia, a social worker with Rescate, which would like to expand the project to other cities in Spain if they can find the funding. “There’s an ever-growing waiting list, because the project doesn’t have the capacity to respond to everyone.”\\n\"The take-up has been tremendous, overwhelming.

Working alone in the rubble of his house and the flattened neighbourhood beyond, he slowly began to clear the debris and fill the gaping holes in the walls left by years of shelling.\\nAbdul Kader is among more than 11 million Syrians who have been driven from their homes by more than six years of brutal conflict. More than five million people have fled to neighbouring countries since the start of the crisis in 2011, with a further 6.3 million displaced inside Syria.\\nIn total, Abdul Kader and his family were displaced five times, moving from one neighbourhood to another inside Homs as the fighting closed in around them. The experience left them afraid and exhausted, but was particularly hard on the children, who had to leave their school and friends behind.\\n“Every time we moved, I fell further behind in school. So many days were wasted,” Abdul Kader’s 12-year-old son Saleh explains. Like his father, Saleh was pained to see what remained of his former school.\\n“Regardless of the circumstances, there is no place like home.\"\\xa0\\n“This is the school where I spent my days, my life,” he said, looking up at walls scarred by bullet holes, with rows of brightly painted classrooms visible through bombed-out windows. “It used to be so beautiful, and to see it like this…” he added, his voice trailing off.\\nDespite the destruction, Abdul Kader was determined to return and take his family back home. With financial assistance from UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, the family has been able to renovate much of what remained of their home, replacing doors and windows and repairing the water and electricity networks.\\nNone\\nThough currently one of only five families that have returned to the devastated Khalidiya neighbourhood, Abdul Kader and his family are determined to finish rebuilding both their home and their lives.\\nFor Saleh, after years of displacement and conflict he is raising his sights to the heavens, where one day he hopes to travel himself. “I want to continue studying and become an astronaut,” he explained. “What’s happening now will not stop me. I want to focus on my education and not give up.”\\nAbdul Kader is content with trying to reclaim his old life, and feels he has made a difficult but important first step. “Regardless of the circumstances, there is no place like home. The feeling of coming back is great. I feel like a bird that has returned to its nest after being away for so long.”“I really believe that education gives people the opportunity to overcome obstacles, stereotypes and hardships they’ve endured in the past. Education not only opens doors, it opens minds,” Ekhlas says. “But if you don’t feel safe it’s so hard to learn.”\\nAs a graduate student, Ekhlas is aware of the incredible opportunities education can provide. But as a young refugee in Egypt, she also experienced the hopelessness of missing out on two essential years of school.\\nResettled Sudanese refugee gives back to U.S. community\\nEkhlas and her family are from Darfur – a region in the sub-Saharan country of Sudan whose name has become synonymous with intractable civil war and vicious atrocities. Ekhlas, her parents, and her three younger brothers fled to Egypt where they applied for asylum and waited for an opportunity to begin their lives again.\\nTheir case was eventually referred for resettlement by UNHCR, and after two years of security screenings and interviews, they were accepted by the United States. In 2005, they were resettled to Portland, Maine.\\n“Being resettled gave me a chance,” Ekhlas says. “It gave me hope again. It gave me an opportunity to find myself and accomplish my dream of getting my degree and getting educated. It gave me a voice that I’m able use everywhere I go to advocate.”\\n“I have a better life because of someone’s hard work – someone volunteered their time to help me become who I am today. So that’s why I want to do my part to make it better for the next generation.”\\nBut while her family’s most painful struggles ended when they moved to the United States, there were still many new challenges ahead. When they first arrived in Maine, for example, no one in Ekhlas’ family spoke English.\\n“We felt like strangers, especially when you don’t speak the language, you can’t express your feelings. You don’t just feel hopelessness — you just feel like you don’t belong.”\\nBut with the help of her community, she was able to achieve her goals of learning English and continuing her education. “Now I am not only able to speak the language, but also teach the language.” Ekhlas says. “I was able to graduate from high school, graduate from college, and now in graduate school, I give back to the city of Portland because they have supported me for the longest time.”\\nWhile working towards her master’s degree in education, Ekhlas volunteers through Americorps as a teacher at the same high school where she first learned English and later earned her diploma.\\n“Many of the students I work with are refugees. There are so many challenges that they go through, so having a safe space is very important, and it’s our job as educators to provide that,” she says. “Because at the end of the day, refugees just want the same thing as anybody else — they want to live in a place that’s safe.”\\nWhen Ekhlas got the opportunity to learn, she used her education to help others. Her story exemplifies the incredible ways in which refugees can give back to their communities when given the chance to get an education.\\n“I have a better life because of someone’s hard work – someone volunteered their time to help me become who I am today. So that’s why I want to do my part to make it better for the next generation,” she said. “Because someone did that for me.”“I started my education when I was 14 because there was no school for me to go to,” said the youngster, who attends an informal school each day in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur with her 15-year-old sister, Yasmin.\\nChild refugees such as Shamshidah frequently have their education disrupted after they are uprooted from home and have to find their way with their families in the country that shelters them, although the reception they receive varies.\\nIn Malaysia, where there are 150,000 refugees registered with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, refugees do not have legal status.\\nAs such, Rohingya children – who are from a conservative Muslim minority whose families fled violence in Myanmar more than 10 years ago -- are denied access to public education, compelling UNHCR, its NGO partners and the refugee communities themselves to support a parallel school system.\\n\"My friends don’t go to school ... I feel sorry for them.\"\\nHer late start means that Shamshidah studies in a primary-level class with younger students, where they learn English, maths and science. While she is lagging behind her age group, she nevertheless appreciates the chance to study. “I don’t mind,” she said. “I hope to go on to secondary school and learn computers.”\\nRohingya student enrolls in informal school for refugees in Malaysia\\nNone\\nFor Rohingya children in Malaysia, the outlook is even worse. As of December 2016, just over a third - 39 per cent – of school age children have access to any education, while the remainder are classed as being out of school, according to UNHCR’s education unit in Malaysia.\\nWhat education they receive is in 120 informal learning centres throughout Malaysia, run by the refugee community or faith-based organizations, with support from UNHCR. Many struggle with limited funding, overcrowded classrooms and few resources.\\nOther challenges include a high turnover of teachers, students who drop out for financial or cultural reasons, and limited opportunities for higher education.\\n“My friends don’t go to school, some friends work in the market, some friends are married, and others have to take care of their siblings … I feel sorry for them,” said Shamshidah.\\nThe schools, like the one in Kuala Lumpur that Shamshidah and her younger sister Yasmin now attend, frequently rely on volunteer teachers, some of whom are retired educators, like Mira*.\\n\"I don´t know how to read or write ... That is why I don´t want my children to work but to study.”\\n“A friend asked me if I wanted to volunteer. As I had been teaching children all my life, I said ‘why not?’” said Mira*, who is also volunteering to improve the curriculum at the refugee learning centre. “Children are children,” she added. “They need have no nationality, they need education.”\\xa0\\nAccess to education is seen as key for the more than 21 million refugees worldwide, more than half of whom are children. While appreciative of support from informal schools, UNHCR, supports access to state education for refugees in Malaysia.\\n“Any support towards education access to refugee children will enable UNHCR to gradually phase out the informal parallel education system that it currently supports, and channel the resources towards programmes that mutually benefit the refugee children as well as those from the host community,” said Mimi Zarina Amin, head of education at UNHCR Malaysia.\\nAlthough she did not attend school herself, Shamshidah’s mother Aminah is supportive of her daughters and hopes their education will open doors for them that she missed out on.\\n“I was born in a poor family and I had to find my ways to find food,” Aminah said, listing the ways that a lack of an education affects her every day. “Every time I take a taxi, I don’t know the numbers, I don´t know how to read or write, I don’t know how to do anything. That is why I don´t want my children to work but to study.”\\nWhile Shamshidah feels self-conscious about being older than her classmates, Aminah encourages her. “I tell her not to feel shy because this is for you not for me,” said Amina. \\xa0“I want you to go to school for you.”After a short ride across Lake Rwamunga, in western Uganda, the captain pulls over near a floating net cage and turns off the engine.

Savings are also put towards a loan fund, from which members can borrow money to start their own businesses.\\nThe fish farming association is made up of 20 refugees from Oruchinga settlement and five Ugandans from a nearby village. They take turns every day to feed and harvest the fish, and sell the day’s catch. The group keeps a book to record withdrawals and deposits made by the members, including payment of individual shares towards the loan fund, and loan requests.\\nSavings book in her hands, a Ugandan member of the association, Aisha, keeps record of the transactions with villagers as they buy the fish.

After paying in to the association for a period, she got her first loan six months ago to build a new house.\\n“I was ashamed to have my parents live in that old hut,” she says, pointing to a large crack running across the side of one wall of her old home. “But that’s a big project … and for a big project, one needs a lot of money.”\\nShe started small, with a US$30 loan. She bought a pregnant pig and within weeks was able to sell seven piglets. “By then, I had enough money to pay for construction materials and labour. My dream was at my fingertips,” she says.\\n\"I had enough money to pay for construction materials and labour.

Now a civilian again, he continues to defend his country and the humane ideals upon which it was built.\\n“When you get out of the military you think, ‘What’s the next mission?’ Seeing those affected by war, protecting human rights and national security led me to start Veterans for American Ideals last year to advocate for military interpreters and Syrian refugees.\"\\nFor U.S. veteran, compassion for refugees is key to genuine security\\nNone\\n“Regardless of what you think about those wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we should be welcoming those victims of those conflicts,” Cooper says. “As a veteran, this is about who we are – this is about our security.”\\nIn response to plans to bar refugees from seven war-torn countries from entering the United States, Cooper earlier this year led a delegation of refugees from six of the seven countries affected to Capitol Hill.\\nJoined by a former officer of the U.S. Army\\'s elite Green Berets, they met with staff in the offices of senators Ed Markey, Joe Manchin, John McCain and Marco Rubio, among others – to attest to the rigor of the U.S. refugee vetting process.\\n“If people were to understand the process of those vetted, we would be better off,” Cooper says. “There is a false narrative that refugees are somehow not vetted… Nothing could be further from the truth. Look at what they go through.”\\nNone\\nCooper says he strives to live his beliefs every day. He has helped more than a dozen people, refugees as well as Iraqis and Afghans with special immigrant visas, resettle in the United States only after they have completed the rigorous U.S. government vetting process.\\nCooper is the father of two daughters, both now in their 20s.

Worried mothers seem comforted by his caring manner.\\n“Saving lives is a huge responsibility,” he says. “This is what I always wanted to do and I wouldn’t change my job for anything.”\\nA refugee from Burundi, 35-year-old Bosco works as a nurse in a health centre in Nakivale settlement, nearly 300 kilometres west of Uganda’s capital Kampala.\\n“I am so thankful that I could use my skills and qualifications to do what I love to do.”\\nThe facility is one of 70 in Uganda that provides services to both refugees and locals, the outcome of a national “integrated service delivery” programme. Receiving steady funding, Nakivale health centre has grown in size and capacity over the years, keeping pace with the increasing refugee population. Today, it serves more than 120,000 refugees and 40,000 Ugandans.\\nThe integrated service delivery programme also allows health centres like Nakivale to employ Ugandans and refugees alike, based on a competitive selection process. It is this process that gave Bosco the opportunity to do what he is so passionate about – caring for others.\\n“Some days, there are more locals than refugees here, especially at the Nutrition Services Department,” says Bosco. “Whether a patient comes from the village or is a refugee, it doesn’t matter. For me, they are all people in need of care, and I treat them equally.”\\xa0\\nIn the men’s ward, William, a 60-year-old Ugandan patient with a chest complaint, sits up on the edge of his bed as Bosco monitors his laboured breathing. “Every time I fall sick I come to this hospital. They always manage to sort me out without fail,” he says.\\nBosco, who works at the hospital at Nakivale settlement, tends to refugees and locals alike.\\nWilliam lives in Ruhoko, a village in the outskirts of Nakivale settlement. He says he has used the health centre for over 10 years, during which he has seen services improve as refugee numbers rose. “There are certainly more drugs than there used to be. It’s a good thing that refugees have settled here. We live like one community.”\\nIn 1998, Bosco enrolled in a school for paramedics in Burundi’s Ngozi province and got a degree in nursing in the midst of a civil war. “There was so much fear and uncertainty those days. My classmates and I used to spend one week at school and one week in the bush hiding from the gunmen who wanted us to fight.”\\nBy 2001, he feared that he would be forcibly recruited and get swept up in the violence. Kissing his mother goodbye, he crossed the border into Tanzania and then Uganda – his nursing qualification tucked among his few belongings. He made it to Nakivale within weeks.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAfter starting out as a volunteer at the clinic 16 years ago, he has been on a full-time contract since 2005, with a monthly salary and family benefits.\\n“I am so thankful that I could use my skills and qualifications to do what I love to do,” he says. “I consider myself self-sufficient as I am able to provide for my family and pay for my children’s education. I have a dignified life here.”\\nHe is both thankful and surprised by the “warm welcome” he found in Uganda. “I never thought I would be able to find such a rewarding job and follow my dream in a foreign country.”\\nThe extent of that welcome became clear when Bosco recently became ill himself. Diagnosed with cancer, he had to travel to neighbouring Kenya for treatment. “My colleagues raised the money to help me undergo surgery. I don’t know where I would be right now if it wasn’t for them.”\\nBut Bosco still needs further treatment. He hopes to be resettled to another country with more advanced medical care. “Uganda gave me so much, but I have to look after my health now. My family needs me, and I need them.”\\nThe integrated service delivery as provided in Nakivale clinic is a key element of Uganda’s Refugee and Host Population Empowerment (ReHoPE) strategy,\\xa0a multi-partner initiative\\xa0which encourages refugees and their hosts to live together as one community and become more self-reliant.\\n“The refugees and the Ugandan people need the world’s support.”\\nThe government grants refugees freedom of movement, the right to work and start a business and access public services such as education, healthcare and justice. Refugees are also given a plot of land, either by the government or local communities, to build their home and to cultivate.\\nBut with over 1.25 million refugees and more than half of them arriving in less than a year, this policy is under threat. The country has limited resources and Uganda cannot continue to support so many refugees without help.\\n“Uganda’s approach to extend and protect refugee rights is commendable but it is not enough to enable refugees to thrive,” says Bornwell Kantande, the representative in Uganda for UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. He explains that refugees’ ability to be truly self-sufficient is directly linked to available resources and investments by humanitarian and development partners.\\nNone\\n“The refugees and the Ugandan people need the world’s support,” says Kantande.\\xa0Wissam Al-Obaidi, 36, and Ali Hussein Abalsad, 27, were returned to Croatia under the Dublin Regulation, which establishes criteria for deciding which European state should consider an asylum seeker’s application.

I had made an effort to learn German and now I had to start learning Croatian.”\\n“I just wanted a safe place for my family,” says Wissam. “It didn’t have to be Austria or Germany. In retrospect, I think I should have applied to Croatia in the first place.”\\n“It was a terrible blow when I was sent back.\"\\nCroatia, still recovering from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s which left it to cope with refugees from the region, was at the centre of a new emergency\\xa0in 2015/2016 when 650,000 asylum-seekers from the Middle East and beyond crossed the border at Tovarnik.\\nSince then, Croatia has also started to receive asylum-seekers under the European Union (EU)\\xa0relocation scheme from Italy and Greece.

Now I had to start all over again.\"\\n\"Now I had to start all over again.\"\\n“But after a few days, the police came and said I\\xa0had\\xa0an interview.\\xa0And after another 15 days, I had a second interview. This was the first step to me feeling hope again.”\\nThe two men were granted asylum in Croatia. “When I was in detention in Austria,\\xa0I wanted to die,” Ali says. “Here in Croatia, I started to believe in something again. I am grateful to the Croatian government.”\\nOnce the men had obtained official refugee status, their families became eligible to apply for reunification.\\nIn Baghdad, Wissam’s wife Shaemaa, a sports teacher, began packing for herself and their two sons, Ahmed, seven, and Yousif, four. The family flew via Cairo and Istanbul and arrived in Zagreb in January 2017.\\nShaemaa attends Croatian classes run by the Red Cross and the boys go to school and kindergarten. Wissam has a job at a car wash and is proudly bringing home an income.\\nAs for Ali, reunion with his wife and three-year-old son may take longer. \\xa0He urgently needs to find a job to be able to contribute towards his family’s travel expenses. Interviews at an ice-cream factory and a construction site came to nothing but he hopes his latest attempt to get employment at a supermarket will be successful.\\xa0\\nNoneThe cycle team are childhood friends who got split up when they fled their native Eritrea more than a year ago. Once in Addis Ababa, they found each other again through their love of competitive cycling. Each push of the pedal brings them new hope.\\n“Cycling is a key part of my life. It’s the exercise – I feel happy and relaxed and don’t think about anything else when riding a bike,” says Filimon, 24. He describes how he learned to ride a bicycle as a teenager back home. “I used to compete with my friends every Sunday in the neighbourhood. My parents also supported me a lot.”\\nFilimon first arrived in Ethiopia by himself in 2015 and lived in the Main Aini refugee camp, in the northern Tigray region. He later moved to Mekelle where he got the chance to cycle once again.\\nMeet the refugee cyclists pedalling for glory.\\n“I joined a cycling team for six months,” he says. He later moved to the capital, Addis Ababa.\\nFilimon never imagined that cycling would reunite him with childhood friends. “It happened by chance. We fled for different reasons and at different times, but then found ourselves reunited here in Addis Ababa, thanks to our coach,” says Filimon with joy.\\n\"I feel happy and relaxed and don’t think about anything else.”\\nWhile they are from different backgrounds, these motivated young refugees support and inspire each other. “I used to be a professional cyclist.” says Daniel, 24, another member of the team who uses his expertise to train his friends. “This team has become my family. We share everything, including money to tackle our financial problems,” he adds.\\nSince 2000, Ethiopia has received and hosted almost 170,000 Eritrean refugees, many of whom are children who flee unaccompanied or separated from their families. The Ethiopian Government allows refugees to live outside of camps, in urban settings if they can sustain themselves. Some 20,000 refugees have chosen to live in Addis.\\nFilimon, 24, has been riding a bike since he was 14.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Diana Diaz\\nHowever, access to jobs remains a challenge for most urban refugees. Filimon, Daniel and the rest of the team rely on their families and Ethiopian friends for support. “The entire community is supporting us, especially the person who sells us equipment for half the price,” says Filimon. “He does that because he used to be a refugee himself and understands us.”\\nIn September 2016, Ethiopia made nine significant pledges as part of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants to improve the living conditions of refugees in the country. These include providing work permits to refugees to have access to jobs as any foreigner would. This will be especially helpful for refugees like Filimon and Daniel who struggle to make ends meet.\\nSo far they have only been able to compete in numerous road races within Ethiopia, getting placed first and third in two competitions. But pedaling their aged bicycles, the six friends continue to dream of the day when they can race in international competitions.\\n“As refugees, it is difficult to cycle internationally because we can neither represent Eritrea nor Ethiopia,” says Filimon. “Our team does not receive sufficient support that we need to perform our best.”\\nFilimon and his team repair their bikes. \\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Diana Diaz\\nDespite these constraints, the team remains driven and their spirit has inspired their community. Within their three day a week training routine, Filimon, Daniel and the rest of the team are cheered on by Ethiopians as well.\\n“We share our experience with them and we hope one day we will also become as good in cycling as they are in running,” says Daniel, referencing Ethiopian long distance runners’ strong showing in global competitions.\\nThe friends push through their difficulties together. “You hear of a lot of people moving onwards to other countries to find opportunities. Previous members of our team have gone too,” says Daniel.\\n“But this is our passion and what we want in life; this is what is keeping us here.” He imagines himself and the team as professional cyclists in 10 years. “If you work hard, you will one day reach your dream. But we need more support.”A few years later, now the mother of two young children, she saw her husband fatally shot in front of her in a violent car-jacking and soon afterwards her brother, with whom she had been reunited after a long separation, was also killed.\\nHowever, today Bora is happy. She and her children –\\xa0Amina, five, and seven-year-old Ibrahim –\\xa0are leaving their township home near Cape Town to start a new life in France under a UN Refugee Agency,\\xa0UNHCR, scheme to resettle the most vulnerable refugees.\\nInterviewed by UNHCR in her small house in the township of Delft shortly before her departure, Bora described the growing xenophobia in South Africa and how she came to live in fear for herself and her children.\\n“My husband was murdered, then my brother … I don’t know why,” she said, as Amina, whose hearing is impaired, and Ibrahim played nearby. “Since then, I’m afraid whenever anyone looks at me.” In Delft, it is best to avoid attracting attention, especially if you are a foreigner.\\n“My husband was murdered, then my brother.\"\\nBora grew up in the city of Uvira in South Kivu Province in the DRC, on the northern shore of Lake Tanganyika. After her parents were killed, she first sought shelter with her uncle but, at the age of 15, decided to flee the conflict. She set off on a five-month odyssey that eventually took her to South Africa.\\n“It was war, my father was dead, my mother was dead,” she said. “Life was so hard… I felt bad, stressed. Sometimes I could not eat.”\\xa0\\nShe travelled across Tanzania, where she spent a month in prison for having no identity documents. After her release she continued her journey, on foot and by boat and train, stopping off in Malawi en route. Eventually, she reached South Africa, having lost contact with her sister and two brothers.\\nShe arrived in the township of Philippi, near Cape Town, where a fellow Congolese refugee, Rusiga, took her under his wing and helped her to find accommodation and apply for asylum. Soon afterwards, they married and moved to Delft to open a business.\\nRusiga ran a small hairdressing salon and set up a makeshift grocery store for her, where she sold soft drinks and sweets. “But with the shop the problems started. There were always thieves in the house.”\\nHer voice dropped and she looked away as she described the attack by three armed men while they were in their car outside their house, during which her husband was fatally shot.\\xa0“Amina was still a baby in my arms. Ibrahim, who was three at the time was sitting in the back,\" she recalled.\\xa0The gunmen surrounded the car and fired on her husband, but she managed to run into the house with Amina and hid in the toilet. The attackers caught Ibrahim in the car and beat him.\\nThe boy managed to escape and rejoin his mother as the thieves drove off in the car. Her husband, who was badly wounded, managed to drag himself into the street to speak to a passer-by. He handed over his cell phone and asked the stranger to call for an ambulance, but he simply ran off with the phone.\\nBora eventually found him lying in the street covered in mud and blood. “He told me: ‘Look after the children … I think I’m dying’.” Bora went to get help, “but no-one would help me. No-one.”\\n\"No-one would help me. No-one.”\\nAfter the death of her husband, her brother who lived in Durban, came to live with her and help look after the children. A year passed and things seemed to be improving for the family, and Bora hoped she could put the events of the past behind her.\\n“One day, I was in the house and someone called me, told me my brother was shot. I went to the hospital, but it was too late.”\\nHer brother’s death was one family tragedy too many for Bora. She fell into a depression and a friend suggested she seek psychiatric help. She attended the Cape Town Trauma Centre for Survivors of Violence and Torture, which steered her towards the local UNHCR office.\\nWhen she told her story, UNHCR representatives realised the family met the agency’s vulnerability criteria and a case was put forward for their resettlement. A month later the application was accepted by France.\\nIlija Todorovic, UNHCR’s senior regional resettlement officer for Southern Africa, said South Africa was one of the main countries from which the agency had submitted cases for resettlement of refugees, “because specific locations in South Africa have been affected by serious security problems due to xenophobia.”\\n\"I went to the hospital, but it was too late.\"\\n“France asks us to submit very vulnerable cases, cases with protection problems or specific medical needs. Strong cases, quantifiable and justifiable. They want to be sure that these persons are real refugees. And they also take certain cases that have specific needs for urgent resettlement.”\\nAlthough Bora knows little about France and is a little fearful of the unknown, she is pleased to be leaving. “Sometimes I am scared, sometimes happy. But now I am very happy.”\\nAs the hour of departure approaches, Bora and the children are dressed in their Sunday best. They are escorted to the airport by an official of the International Organization for Migration, Zoe Rohde, who helps them organize their luggage.\\nWith a final backward glance, Bora says: “I am happy to leave Delft, but sad to leave my friends and my [other]\\xa0brother here.”\\nShe\\xa0would like to visit them one day, “but not in Delft. I don’t want to come back in Delft, this place is not safe”.\\nAt the airport, after a tearful goodbye to her friends, Bora turns her back on the past and walks through the departure gate and into her new life.\\xa0Armed with an extraordinary brain and an iron will, 18-year-old Nujeen is determinedly adjusting to her new life in Europe. Alongside attending school for the first time and rapidly learning German, she still finds time to use her newfound prominence as a platform for positive change.\\n“We need some optimism in the world,” says Nujeen, who now lives with her family in Wesseling, a small city in western Germany. \"I always believed everyone’s here for a mission, but I hadn’t found mine yet. Now I have a voice, I can help people.”\\n\"Now I have a voice, I can help people.”\\nNone\\nNujeen remembers watching a news report one day six years ago when the unrest in the streets outside her window heralded the start of the Syrian conflict. She never dreamed it would kickstart the series of events that led her to a new life in Europe.\\n“I’ve really grown to appreciate what I have in the last two years because I know what it means not to have these things,\" she says, eager to demonstrate the near-fluent German she learned in under 18 months. \"If someone told me back then I was going to have this stable life, I would have said they’re crazy. I wasn’t sure if I was going to wake up the next day. None of us were.”\\nAs the war intensified, Nujeen and her family escaped Aleppo for northern Syria, before eventually crossing the border to Turkey. There, the family split. Nujeen’s brother Bland went ahead to join their eldest brother, Shiar, who had settled in Germany a decade earlier. Soon after, in September 2015, Nujeen, her four young nieces and two sisters followed, leaving their parents behind.\\nNujeen remembers the moment she was photographed by UNHCR photographer Ivor Prickett, being lifted out of a flimsy dinghy after washing up on the Greek island of Lesvos. “I had been in Europe five minutes and I was already famous,” she laughs. Before long, her face was flashing up on news bulletins across the world.\\n“You’re in a constant test, you want to prove to be a good ambassador of your country,” Nujeen adds. “People don’t realize how hard we’re all trying to rebuild our lives from zero. I’d say to them: Try to get to know us. There’s more inside us and inside you than everyone thinks.”\\nNujeen, then 16, is carried out of a flimsy dinghy after washing up on the Greek island of Lesvos. \\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Ivor Prickett\\nThat process of rebuilding can be deeply frustrating. Nujeen had hoped to apply for her parents, still living in Turkey, to join her as part of the family reunification procedures. But her asylum application took so long to be approved that she is now too old to do so. Her residency came through in December, just a month before she turned 18.\\nNow that she’s legally an adult, Nujeen’s parents are no longer eligible to join her. Family reunification is generally limited to members of the core family, including spouses, parents and minor children.\\n“UNHCR calls on states to consider the individual circumstances of a refugee family and demonstrate flexibility in considering other family members eligible for family reunification, where they formed part of a household, affected by flight and separation, and are dependent on each other,” says UNHCR Representative Katharina Lumpp in Berlin.\\n\"I’m going to try to make people believe in a better tomorrow.”\\nDaily life for Nujeen now centres around the flat she shares with her brother, two sisters and four young nieces. Every day, a bus picks her up and takes her to a school for children with disabilities. There, she has physical therapy to help with her condition. “Being disabled doesn’t define me, what I am, who I am or what I can do,\" she says. \"There are so many less lucky than I am now. I may have a nice flat and can go to school, but people are still suffering. What scares me the most is that me, my family, my people will just be a number on a forgotten page in history. I’m going to do my best to work against that.”\\nNujeen hopes to study physics at university. “I love space, I want to be an astronaut,” she says. “I’d like to look for aliens. It’s the biggest unsolved mystery. I want to know, are we alone?”\\n“I never give up hope. God didn’t create me to be miserable. I want to find happiness in the little things I have and have others be happy, no matter how bad and dark the situation seems. Nothing lasts forever, even war. I’m going to try to make people believe in a better tomorrow.”The monthly get-together in Neu Wulmstorf, near Hamburg in northern Germany, is an opportunity for some of the town’s 300 refugees and asylum-seekers to mix with residents. For the community’s dedicated army of volunteers, the benefits are mutual.\\n\"The refugees are an asset,\" said Cornelia Meyer, 44, co-founder of the refugee support network responsible for the meetings. “Since we founded this network and the refugees came, I’ve felt a lot better about living here.”\\nShe continued: “They’ve brought the big wide world with them, they’ve brought in a lot of openness that just wasn’t here before. We’re a wide range of volunteers in the group, but everyone has taken the newcomers into their hearts. We all get so much back from this work.”\\n\"Refugees are an asset.\"\\nMeyer, a social worker, launched the volunteer initiative Welcome to Neu Wulmstorf in summer 2014 after hearing the town’s refugee population was about to grow. With the help of the community centre, she recruited a core group of 40 volunteers willing to do whatever it took to make the newcomers feel at home.\\nThree years later, the network is as active as ever. Besides one-on-one support, the volunteers offer swimming lessons, a cycle repair workshop, language courses, game evenings, cinema events and day trips to local attractions.\\n“I was lucky to end up here,” said Syrian refugee Mohammad Al-Akily, 27, who arrived in Neu Wulmstorf in December 2015, having fled fighting near his home in \\xa0Hama, western Syria. “The people here are very friendly. They help us if we have questions. I never expected it, I always thought I would have to struggle on my own. But it’s very beautiful that so many people here help us like this.”\\nMohammad’s biggest thanks go to volunteers Heino Rahmstorf and Thomas Bartens, who have spent the past year teaching him to swim. Every Saturday morning, Mohammad and a group of other beginners, practise diving, front crawl and breast stroke in the local pool.\\nBefore learning to swim, Mohammad first had to overcome the memory of a near-death experience in the Aegean Sea. Like many others, his overcrowded dinghy sank while crossing from Turkey to Greece in summer 2015. Although he could not swim, Mohammad survived for more than an hour in the water, fighting to stay afloat until he was rescued. The ordeal left him with a deep fear of water.\\n\\xa0“At first it was terrible, I kept sinking,” said Mohammad, recalling his first attempts to swim in the pool. “I was very scared of the water. But that’s why I knew I should learn to swim. Now I’m much calmer. I’ve even swum in the sea.”\\nIt is not just swimming that Mohammad has mastered in the past year. With the help of volunteer-run language classes, Mohammad is fast approaching the level of German he needs to go back to university, where he wants to study engineering.\\nHe hopes to return to Syria, where his siblings and parents still live. “I hope that one day my home country improves and I can go home and help rebuild,” he said. “There’s always hope, that’s all we can have.” Meanwhile, he’s happy to be able to rely on the support of community volunteers in building his new life in Germany.\\n“There’s always hope, that’s all we can have.”\\n“It seems a lot of the newcomers feel at home here,” said volunteer network co-founder Hannelore Schade, 54. “People know they can always come here and that we’ll always try to help.”\\nKatharina Lumpp, representative of the UN refugee agency UNHCR in Germany, said the large number of volunteers in the country had helped meet the challenges posed by the refugees’ arrival.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The vibrant civil society in Germany has significantly contributed to addressing the challenges that emerged with the arrival of so many people in need of protection”, she said.\\nOrganisers Schade and Meyer said it was impossible to reach all of Neu Wulmstorf’s newcomers, but seeing the results of their hard reflected in the progress of individuals kept them motivated.\\n“The volunteers here feel really valued,” said Schade. “Everyone knows their work plays a key role in the integration process. And when volunteers are appreciated, they are more likely to stick at it.”“When we came here, we didn’t even know how to say ‘Hello’, we didn’t know anything,” says Duret, straining to make his voice heard over the steady hum of machines. “But once we learnt a bit of Portuguese, we found there was no difference between us and our colleagues. We all work together.”\\nNext to him on the production line are his in-laws, Jamal and Hani. All three men are from an extended Palestinian Iraqi refugee family who were relocated to Portugal a year ago, as part of the European Union Relocation scheme.\\n“We believe we have a social responsibility,” says human resources manager Roberto Madeira. “And we need competent people to work. We are the biggest employer in the area and we need to fill our quota of workers.”\\nThe Duret family are now settling into the small community of Batalha, Portugal.\\n“We believe we have a social responsibility.\"\\nSince 2015, Portugal has played an active role in relocation, relocating over 1,200 refugees in towns and cities across the country. Prime Minister António Costa has upped his country’s pledge from 4,000 to 10,000 in what many see as an attempt to boost the country’s economy.\\nPortugal was hit hard by the global economic crisis and many of the country’s youth have been forced to leave in search of jobs. Many refugees did not consider it as a possible new home.\\nBatalha’s local councillor Cintia Silva believes the country has a lot to offer the newcomers. “The success of our process is that the private sector is involved too, even the social sector – everyone is working together,” she says. “It is easier to work with small communities and if everyone is working for the same goal, for integration. The refugees feel that they are wanted and needed here.”\\nMatt Ceramics Factory is one of the largest employers in the area.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Bruno Galán Ruiz\\nSmall town life clearly has its advantages for Duret’s four-generation family, who have been uprooted three times in their lifetimes. It all began in the violence of 1948, when grandmother Taqia, now 77, fled the town of Haifa, where she was born, for Iraq. She lived in Baghdad for over 50 years, until the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2002.\\nBut after violence and instability ripped their neighbourhood apart, the family felt they couldn’t stay. The final straw came when Taqia’s grandson was kidnapped and held to ransom. As soon as they secured his release, part of the family fled to Syria, while the other half left for Libya. Neither countries offered lasting stability.\\nIn 2012, family members in Syria joined the others in Libya after missiles hit their home. Then, when Islamic extremist arrived in the Libyan city of Sirte, they were forced to flee once more. “It was terrible,” recalls Duret. “There was no security. There were executions in the streets that they forced us to watch and I didn’t want my children to see that. My wife had to wear the niqab – she was afraid to leave the house and we were robbed many times.”\\nTaqia, 77, left her home in Haifa in 1948 and has never returned.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Bruno Galán Ruiz\\nIn September 2015, all eight members of the family boarded a small boat, along with over 500 passengers from Africa and Syria. Smugglers only allowed them to take one small bag of food and water. For a day, they floated at sea, terrified, until they were spotted by an Italian rescue boat.\\nTaqia’s daughter Sawan still remembers her relief. “The moment they came to save us and put us in the big boat, I felt like I had been born again. I knew we were safe. We had turned a new page.”\\nFor the next year, the family were moved from one reception centre to another on the island of Lampedusa, and finally to Rome. \\xa0Their initial hope was to join other family members in Sweden, but then they opted to take part in the relocation scheme.\\n\"Even for us, we are learning every day. It is nice to have different cultures.\"\\nA year into their new lives in the small town Batalha, the family have become part of this small community. The boys go to the local school and speak fluent Portuguese. Taqia takes part in regular exercise classes at the town hall, whilst\\xa0Sawan and her daughter Tahani have become regular faces at the market. Every week, a local teacher comes to the house to give the adults language classes.\\n\"Everyone knows them,” says councillor Cintia. “They are all our friends, we go to their houses, they are always inviting us to tea, to dinner, to try different foods. And, even for us, we are learning every day. It is nice to have different cultures, so everyone is learning with this experience.”\\nTwo months ago, the family welcomed the latest arrival, Adam, who was born at the local hospital in Batalha. Looking at his son, Duret explains what this new chance has meant for all four generations of his family. “As Palestinians who left in 1948, we have been refugees for more than 70 years,\" he says. \"The most important thing for us is that we have stability, which we never had in Iraq, Syria or Libya.”Despite his confidence in the water, 16-year-old Ali could not even swim until a few years ago. Growing up in landlocked Aleppo, Syria’s second city, he fled with his family to Lebanon in 2011. They settled in Jiyeh, an ancient coastal town 28 kilometres south of Beirut.\\nThe area is home to Lebanon\\'s fledgling surf community. When Ali saw the locals riding the waves, he was mesmerized. He first taught himself how to swim. Then, for months he would perch on a beachside cliff studying each surfer\\'s technique and signature moves.\\n\"Surfing has taught me to be strong in life, that nothing is impossible.\"\\nNow he is one of them, his gold-streaked hair testament to the many hours spent under the Mediterranean sun. Amidst all the difficulties of life in exile, this small stretch of beach has become his refuge. The surfers have become his second family.\\n“Surfing has taught me to be strong in life, that nothing is impossible,” Ali says. “If you want to do something, then you should do it.”\\nHis mentor on the waves smiles as he recalls their first meeting and Ali\\'s early attempts at catching a wave. Thirty-four-year-old Ali El Amine is a Lebanese-American surfer who runs Surf Lebanon, a surfing club and training school. He and a friend spotted the younger Ali one chilly April day two years ago on their way back from scouting waves.\\nAli only saw the sea for the first time in 2011 after his family fled to Lebanon. Video: Houssam Hariri. \\n“We saw this little kid who had a styrofoam board waiting at the water\\'s edge,” El Amine recalls. Ali had evidently used a knife to carve a surfboard from a piece of trash he\\'d found on the beach.\"\\nThey did not think he would risk the choppy waters. It was too dangerous, especially without training or a proper surfboard and wetsuit.\\n“He got halfway out and we called him to come in because he didn’t have a leg rope and the water was still cold,” El Amine says.\\nAli refused: “I told them no. I wanted to try.”\\nA shouting match ensued. El Amine coaxed Ali back onto the beach for a stern lecture on safety. But, impressed with the gutsy teen\\'s determination, El Amine gave him a real board, wetsuit, and surf lessons. “The rest,” he says, “is history.”\\n“The first wave I rode, I was able to stand,” Ali says. “I loved it. I came back every day. It’s an amazing feeling.”\\nFor the last two years, Ali has met El Amine and his crew on the beach anytime the wind and waves are ripe for surfing. Among the group, Ali\\'s status as a refugee doesn\\'t matter. He rides waves along with Lebanon\\'s best. They are competitive but look for each other, supporting one another through new tricks and wipeouts.\\n“He\\'s a human, at the end of the day,” El Amine says. “He breathes and he bleeds. I don\\'t look at it as if he\\'s from a different country or religion. He just has the hunger to surf. And that\\'s all that matters.”\\nEl Amine treats his young protégé – who he calls \"Little Ali\" – as a younger brother or son, sometimes using surfing to reward high marks in school. Low grades equal less time on the surfboard.\\nSurfing also lets Ali focus on the present and future after a painful past. His elder brother was killed five years ago when their neighborhood bakery in Aleppo was bombed while he was out buying bread. The family left for Lebanon shortly afterward. Ali says he can\\'t remember much else about Syria.\\n“When I surf I forget everything.\"\\n“When I surf I forget everything,” Ali says. “Even if I had something on my mind, once I am in the water I forget.”\\nLebanon hosts more than one million Syrian refugees – a massive number for a small country of at least four million people. Services are overstretched, with many refugees unable to access adequate housing, medical care or education.\\nAli considers his family fortunate to live in an apartment. But money is tight. His father, a day laborer, cannot find enough work to support his five children in Lebanon.\\nFinancial troubles led Ali to leave school temporarily. Sometimes he picks up work in the surf shop to help make ends meet, but he plans to resume his studies this summer.\\nHis dream is to compete in a world surfing championship and to travel abroad in search of the best waves. And when the war is over, he hopes to go back to Syria and open a surf school.© UNHCR 2001-2018MADRID, Spain - For more than five weeks, selected refugees have had the chance to learn all aspects of working for multinational furniture company IKEA in the Spanish capital, Madrid.\\nThe unique training programme gives refugees like Ruba, an architect from Syria, and Maria a former bank employee from Ukraine, hands on training at the store, which sells ready-to-assemble furniture, kitchen appliances and home accessories.\\nOnce they complete the work experience programme, participants\\xa0will be able to apply for jobs with IKEA as a first step towards integrating into the Spanish workforce.\\nNoneThey have five hours left to finish the myriad dishes on offer and the kitchen is a hive of activity. Twenty-eight-year-old Rana wraps small bundles\\xa0of rice with cabbage leaves to make waraq anab (vine leaves), whilst 27-year-old Reem is shaping small hollow meat cases ready for kibbe. Fatima, the matriarch of the family, is chopping large handfuls of parsley and mint to get the right texture for another Syrian delicacy, the tangy salad tabboule.\\n\"You can’t imagine the scenes.\"\\nAs they cook, Fatima’s 21-year old son Rafat comes in to check on progress. Although he is not cooking today, Rafat is also a chef in his own right. Back in Damascus, before the war, he used to work at the family restaurant, Zayn.\\n“It was a kebab and chicken restaurant and I was the one who wrapped the sandwiches, cut the pickles, cucumbers and tomatoes,” he explains. “I had to be fast, as it was me who gave the customers their sandwiches.”\\nThose days seem like another lifetime to the family and reminiscing still hurts. In 2012, just a year into the conflict, they were forced to flee their home after clashes between Syrian and opposition forces. They took refuge in Yarmouk camp, waiting until it would be safe to return. But when Rafat’s father visited the family home, to check that it had not\\xa0been destroyed, their world fell apart. His body was later found in a nearby building, along with 149 others.\\n“The bodies were left all over the neighbourhood,” Rafat explains. “They even found people in toilets of the mosque. You can’t imagine the scenes. To this day, I still don’t understand why they killed him.”\\xa0\\nFatima and her family are making new friends and reviving old passions in Portugal.\\nDevastated by his death, Fatima and her four children decided to leave Syria. \\xa0After two weeks sleeping on the streets, they eventually \\xa0fled to Egypt, where they spent nine months surviving off food vouchers and donations from local charities.\\nFatima and her daughters did odd jobs sewing to supplement what little money they had.

Fatima was impressed by the support they received.\\n“When we came to the airport, people were there to welcome us. They took us to us to our new home, they went to work immediately on our papers and residency straight away. They put our kids immediately in the school. Those eleven months were great, the only thing was that the time wasn’t enough for us to adapt and be financially independent.”\\nAfter 11 months, when financial support ended, Fatima worried about how she would support her family. Her son-in-law had a job as a tailor working for a local designer, and the family still received some help. But with seven mouths to feed, including Fatima’s two grandchildren, the pressure was mounting.\\nThen, Fatima got a call asking if she and her daughters would take part in new scheme, Pâo a Pâo (Bread, Bread), a refugee integration project set to launch in December 2016 at the Santa Clara market in Lisbon. The idea was that Syrian refugees would showcase their food at private dinners during the festive season.\\n“When we came to the airport, people were there to welcome us.\"\\nFrancisca Henriques, one of the four founders of Pão Pão, was amazed by the response. “We were totally surprised because it was a huge success,” she says. “Initially, we opened for groups of more than 20 people, but we never had less than 100, it was crazy. One day we had 130 people. It was not only because people were curious about Middle East food – it was because people wanted to help and they didn’t know how.”\\nEncouraged by this success, the founders decided to open a permanent restaurant at the market. They launched a crowd funding campaign to raise funds for the renovation and, within one month, they hit their target of EUR 15,000. Mezze will open in May 2017 and employ 15 refugees. In between meals, the space will offer workshops, cultural exchanges and music.\\nFor Fatima and her children, Mezze will allow them to carry on the family tradition started by their father in Damascus. It will give this proud family the chance to be financially independent in a country they now consider home. Their delicious home cooked dishes will also give locals a taste of Syria.\\n“We found that the Portuguese really like our cooking, because it is full of flavours and spices,” says Fatima, as she puts the finishing touches to her tabbouleh salad, ready for the guests’ arrival. “It is the way we communicate now. We carry on cooking and they are learning.”In November 2015, Pessat-Villeneuve, which has a population of 550, opened the doors of the château as a reception and guidance centre for refugees from Calais and Paris.

It is better than a stress ball.”\\nAt the start of the Syrian conflict, Fadi, 26, was studying commerce and accounting at Tishreen University in the port city of Lattakia. It was here that one of his professors first introduced him to the ancient art of origami, or paper folding. But what began as a novel hobby back in Syria has since become an important part of his life in the camp.\\nOrigami helps Syrian refugee find purpose in exile.\\nFadi is one of around 80,000 Syrians who currently call the bustling Za’atari camp home. In total, Jordan is host to 658,000 registered Syrian refugees, with the vast majority living in towns and cities across the kingdom.\\nFadi was in his third year of university when the conflict forced him to abandon his studies. As the fighting moved closer to their home in Dara’a, and with his father working abroad, Fadi took the decision to move the family to Jordan in October 2013.\\n“I was responsible for 14 souls, mostly women and children,” says\\xa0Fadi, referring to himself plus his nine younger siblings, mother, grandparents and his heavily pregnant wife. “I was so scared that one of them would be killed or hurt.”\\nThey paid smugglers to drive them to the borders of Syria, Jordan and Iraq, where they were dropped off at 5 a.m. and told to walk through the desert towards a distant hill to reach Jordan. But after hours of walking in sweltering temperatures they were surrounded by wilderness, with no food and their water all gone.\\n“It allows you to make something from nothing.\"\\nEventually they met some Bedouin herders who pointed them in the right direction, and they finally reached Jordan after more than 14 hours of walking. Once the Jordanian authorities picked them up, Fadi’s wife, who was seven months pregnant with twins, began to feel pain and was rushed to hospital.\\n“Our twins were stillborn,” says Fadi, simply. “After that we went to Za’atari, and life slowly started again.”\\nFadi’s first priority after settling into the camp was to find work to help support his family. Having previously volunteered back in Syria at a centre for children with Down’s syndrome, he got a job as a classroom assistant on an informal education course for children run by NGO Relief International. The courses are held in the camp at a community centre funded by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.\\n“It was then that I remembered the origami, and thought it would be something interesting and different to try with the kids,” Fadi\\xa0says. The results were overwhelmingly positive, according to Fadi, particularly for those children with special needs or behavioural issues.\\n“The kids loved the fact that you can turn a piece of paper into something else – a bird, or a chair. It improves their concentration and their commitment. When I give them a project, they don’t get distracted or bored, they go for it until they are finished.”\\n“The biggest impact I’ve seen is with Miriam and Mohammed, two kids in the class with Down’s syndrome,” Fadi adds. “They used to have problems with their attention and aggression, but the change has been remarkable. Since they started origami last year\\xa0they have something to focus their efforts on, and they are much calmer and happier as a result.”\\nAs well as bringing enjoyment to his pupils, Fadi also credits his hobby with transforming his life in exile. “It has made me feel like an active member of the community here, and now people in the camp know who I am. It’s given me purpose as a refugee.”\\nFadi describes the simple act of folding paper to make other objects as universal, understood by everyone who has ever made a paper plane, regardless of race or language. He dreams of one day teaching origami to refugee children in other parts of the world. “It’s something new, and I’ve seen how they respond to it. Origami breaks down barriers and gives kids hope.”Thousands of people lie around on the ground around her, exhausted. Men are busy making a shelter for the night. Mothers and young girls hurry to ready porridge for lunch. Sandra is alone in a sea uncertainty and intense emotion.“I have no news about my parents and my siblings,” she sobs. “I prefer not to think about them. It makes me sad. I fear that I may not see them ever again.”\\nSandra, 14, fled to Uganda on April 3 after the South Sudanese army launched a deadly attack on Pajok town, forcing tens of thousands of people to leave their homes and hide in the bush. More than 7,000 crossed to Uganda at Ngomoromo in the course of a week.\\nAmong them are 600 children, separated from their parents. They made the perilous journey alone. Some were girls who were far away from home fetching water or collecting firewood when the attack happened; others are teenagers selling fruit and vegetables at the local market; or students like Sandra.\\n“When the gunshot began, I was in school.\"\\n“When the gunshot began, I was in school. We were learning English vocabulary. I was so afraid. I never heard that sound before. The teacher shouted to get out and ran. My classmates and I were in the front. He was the last one to leave the classroom, making sure that no one was left behind.”\\nSouth Sudanese refugees walk towards the Ugandan border crossing at Ngomoromo carrying their belongings. They are fleeing the town of Pajok after it was attacked by armed groups.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Rocco Nuri\\nSandra and her fellow students arrived in Ngomoromo two days after a long walk through the bush without food and water. She is still wearing the uniform that she had put on to go to school the day of the attack. “When we reached this place, we found many people sleeping on the ground. Some were sitting on the sides of the road. But they were all strangers to me.”\\nSince the onset of the emergency, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency has been running a ‘protection desk’ at the border to identify and assist the most needy: survivors of sexual violence, people with disabilities, the elderly, single mothers, and separated children and unaccompanied minors like Sandra. Working closely with refugee representatives, the UNHCR team on the ground in Ngomoromo was able to reunite some of these children with their parents and arrange temporary foster care for the rest.\\nSandra was briefly reunited with her Aunt.\\n“I wanted Auntie to stay with me, but she went back to South Sudan the following day to look for my parents,” says Sandra. “I am alone again.”\\n\"I don’t know where my husband is. Who is going to take care of my children?\"\\nChristine Achan, 26, sits on a dusty straw mat under the shade of an old concrete waiting station, cradling her newborn in her arms. But her face hardly reflects the joy of bringing a new life into the world. “I thank God that the baby is healthy, but I don’t feel good. I don’t know where my husband is. Who is going to take care of my children? I don’t feel good,” she says with a sense of guilty.\\nChristine was in her last week of pregnancy when the violence split Pajok, where she used to be a teacher.\\n“I was at home getting ready to go to school when I heard the gunshots. Everything happened suddenly. I run to the bush with my two children and my grandmother. We walked for three days without food and water. I thought I would deliver on the way. I had pain in my stomach. I feared I would lose my baby,” she says.\\nUganda: South Sudanese Baby Born into Conflict\\nChristine gave birth to Anwech Varsity two days after arriving in Uganda. “In the midst of this chaos, I found my sister Beatrice. At least I have someone to share my worries with. My children keep asking me about their father. I told them that he is alive and he will soon join us. But I have a bad feeling deep inside.”\\nSince the outbreak of the conflict in South Sudan in 2013, families have been torn apart. Violence, hunger and indiscriminate attacks against civilian populations continue to prompt mass exodus, putting the number of internally displaced people and refugees at respectively 1.9 million and 1.7 million.\\n“Women and children bear the brunt of this senseless war.”\\nUganda currently hosts more than 834,000 South Sudanese refugees, with over 194,000 new arrivals in 2017 alone. Eighty-six percent are women and children, including some 21,000 minors without parents or a legal guardian.\\n“Women and children bear the brunt of this senseless war,” says Bornwell Katande, UNHCR’s Representative in Uganda. “While it is imperative to pursue a political resolution to the conflict, in countries of asylum like Uganda it is vital to provide special support to women and children who have experienced violence, trauma and abuse. But the funding situation is dire.”\\nUNHCR and partners need more than US$558 million to respond to the needs of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, including food, water, shelter and livelihoods.\\n“Four months into 2017, we have received less than 10 percent of the funding. The international community should show share more responsibility towards the world’s fastest growing refugee crisis. What is at stake here is the future of an entire generation of children, who have lost one or both parents, who are unable to go to school or do the ordinary things all children deserve.”\\nDonate now“It already feels like home,” grins Lana. “In Argentina we have learnt how to be human again,” adds Majd, taking a deep drag on his cigarette.\\nThe couple had little choice but to flee Syria. Two years earlier Majd, a cook, narrowly escaped with his life after a bomb hit his parents\\' home in the Old Town of Damascus. He and Lana, a sculptor, got married and bought a flat further from the city centre. But it quickly became “the most dangerous neighbourhood in the whole city,” remembers Majd. “Everyone was scared.”\\nNone\\nMore than 8,000 miles from home, the couple are flourishing. As the first Syrian refugees to arrive in the province in central Argentina, they have become celebrities. They are even starting to get recognised on the street. “Sometimes I feel like a Pokémon,” laughs Majd.\\n\"In Argentina we have learnt how to be human again.\"\\nEstablished in 2014, Argentina’s humanitarian visa programme offers a vital escape route to those fleeing Syria’s war. It requires Argentine citizens, organizations or institutions to act as sponsors and commit private funds to provide newly-arrived refugees with accommodation and financial assistance.\\nSan Luis has gone one step further. It is the first province to pledge public funds to support the resettlement of at least 50 families in the province, 30 of whom will be selected by the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. Those who are resettled are offered free Spanish lessons, accommodation, further education (including the option of studying for a university degree), health insurance and public transport. They also receive two years’ worth of financial support to help them adjust to their new life in Argentina, while they find a job.\\nThe offer came just in time for Lana and Majd. Many of their friends were killed after being conscripted into the Syrian army. Countless others died in the fighting. As the violence worsened, the couple considered fleeing overland to Europe.\\nBut their religion – both are Orthodox Christians – made the journey impossible. The route, through Idlib or Aleppo, would have brought them into contact with extremist militias, who would have killed them for their faith. Concealing it was not an option: Majd has a crucifix prominently tattooed on his right forearm.\\nOnce accepted onto Argentina’s humanitarian visa programme, the couple left Damascus and flew to Buenos Aires. After arriving in Argentina the couple enjoyed practising their religion freely. “We cried when we went to our first church service,” says Lana. They often pray in their new flat, part of a student accommodation block at the University of La Punta, a half-hour drive from the city of San Luis.\\nThe couple is settling in well. They share their flat with Blackie, a rambunctious puppy gifted to them by the provincial governor, Alberto Rodríguez Saá. Twice a week they take the bus into the city for a Spanish class with Claudia, their teacher. They are making extraordinary progress. “We understand everything, we just don’t have the vocabulary to be able to respond yet,” explains Lana.\\nLocals are eager to help. Under the relocation scheme, the province’s residents are encouraged to offer practical support to the new arrivals. Many are stepping forward. Linguists can volunteer as translators, entrepreneurs can offer jobs, even families can find a way to help. “They can meet for dinner together or celebrate a birthday,” explains Liliana Scheines, who co-ordinates the Syrian Refugee Committee, which operates the provincial programme named \\'Humanitarian Corridor San Luis\\'.\\nMario Lange is one of those to put his name forward. An artist with a workshop on the edge of town, his bright and colourful paintings and murals also adorn San Luis’s public buildings. He sympathises with Majd and Lana’s predicament. “I was born into extreme poverty,” he explains. “I lived in the middle of the countryside and when I came to San Luis it was tough.”\\n“The plan is to receive four or five families every couple of months.\"\\nShortly after their arrival, Mario invited Lana along to help him with a public art installation and presented the couple with a pair of hand-painted bicycles. He warns that adjusting to life in San Luis take time. “After few weeks they will begin to realise they are in another country. That’s when they will really need our help.”\\nIn a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York on September 20 last year, Argentine President Mauricio Macri, pledged to resettle 3,000 Syrian refugees. Priority would be given to families with young children, he announced. “The images we are witnessing hurt and worry us,” he told world leaders. “Reality compels us to do more.”\\nIn San Luis, the scheme is only just getting started. “The plan is to receive four or five families every couple of months,” says Scheines. The ambition is to settle them in 60 of the province’s municipalities to better integrate them with San Luis’s residents.\\nUNHCR believes more needs to be done to help some five million Syrian refugees, uprooted by six bloody years of conflict. The provincial government is winning plaudits for its progressive approach. “It’s an amazing programme,” says Michele Manca di Nissa, Regional Representative for UNHCR’s southern Latin America office. “We hope it can be a model for other provinces in Argentina and other countries in the region.” The regional office is advising the province on local integration issues and raising awareness of refugees by organising workshops for journalists and mounting \\'RefugiArte\\', a touring art exhibition.\\nMajd and Lana have not forgotten about Syria. They use social media to follow the news and keep in touch with friends and family. The couple hope to help some of them follow in their footsteps. Their parents “are too old” to leave Syria, says Lana. But some cousins are interested. Majd and Lana are collating their names and passing them onto the Argentine authorities. “It’s like a chain,\" explains Lana. “We are to trying to help as many as we can.”\\nNoneAt the time, however, as a refugee struggling to raise three children alone in Jordan’s Za’atari camp, the 45-year-old from rural Damascus couldn’t recognize there was a problem.\\n“People around me told me they had noticed changes in my behaviour,” Noor remembers. “I was aggressive, anxious around my kids, and my relationships with friends and family were becoming difficult. I can see it now. But when people first told me, I was in denial, and simply rejected their advice.”\\nIt took a domestic accident in their shelter while making tea, which Noor blames on her mental state and which resulted in her daughter suffering minor burns, for her to seek the help she needed. “The nurse at the clinic where my daughter was treated noticed my behaviour, and advised me to see someone.”\\nNone\\n“The nurse at the clinic ... advised me to see someone.”\\nWith around half of Syria’s pre-war population of 22 million forcibly displaced either inside or outside of the country, the six-year conflict has resulted in huge upheaval and loss. Millions have been exposed to hardship and violence, and been torn from their homes, livelihoods and social networks.\\n“Depression is an issue that deeply affects refugees, not only in terms of their mental health but also their day-to-day functioning, protection and access to services,” UNHCR’s Senior Mental Health Officer Pieter Ventevogel explains.\\n“The good news is that with access to professional treatment, as well as the support of trained non-specialists and community members, those with depression can get better. By empowering them with knowledge and strategies, refugees can also play a vital role in their own treatment,” he adds.\\nNoor,* a nursery school teacher who fled the war in Syria, looks on as children play in Za\\'atari Refugee Camp, in Jordan. She is receiving treatment for depression linked to the turmoil of displacement.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Christopher Herwig\\nNoor believes her illness was linked to the turmoil of the past six years, in stark contrast to her settled life in Damascus before the conflict. She and her husband owned two homes in the city, and she had a cherished career as a teacher in a daycare centre.\\n“I had a beautiful, quiet life. My job gave me independence, and we had security and stability,’ she says. “After the war started I saw a lot of horrible things; rockets and bombs. We were displaced inside Damascus, and that’s when the fear and anxiety began.”\\nThe family moved from neighbourhood to neighbourhood in search of safety, and in the process spent their entire savings, leaving Noor feeling destitute. She initially came to Za’atari in 2013 with only her three children, after she and her husband had become separated inside Syria and he ended up fleeing to Lebanon.\\nShe struggled to get by in the camp for more than a year before the accident that finally led to her getting the treatment she needed. After being referred to an International Medical Corps (IMC) mental health clinic in the camp supported by UNHCR, Noor was assigned a case worker who oversaw her care.\\n“Depression is an issue that deeply affects refugees.\"\\nAfter being diagnosed with depression by a mental health professional and prescribed anti-depressants, Noor also attended a series of personal therapy sessions designed to help her contribute to her own treatment. The sessions focused on coping mechanisms and improving her social and communication skills, which she credits with improving her relationships.\\nShe is also grateful for the referral system in the camp that ensured that when the nurse at the hospital first noticed her symptoms, she was able to access professional treatment. Nevertheless, Noor believes that many are still not getting the care they need.\\n“The crisis has forced people to confront mental illness, but there is still a huge stigma around it. Many prefer to remain untreated than to seek help,” she says.\\nToday, Noor says she has a more positive view of life, which has been further boosted by a cleaning job in the camp and a garden that she has planted next to the shelter she shares with her children and reunited husband.\\n“The garden is beautiful, and I have seven chickens and a duck. I enjoy working in it and it helps my mood. I’ve even started doing some community activities, like dressmaking. It’s not like the life I had before, but I’m trying to make the best of what I have.”\\nNone\\n*Name\\xa0changed\\xa0for protection purposes“Where’s your son?” one asked calmly.\\xa0\\nMargarita, who made a living selling bread from a small street stand in her hometown in western El Salvador, recognized many of the gangsters who came to her door that night. She had maintained a tenuous peace with them for years, giving the young men bread to stay in their good graces.\\nBut that all changed when the gang began shaking down her 37-year-old son, Jose, the owner of a small convenience store. He had failed to keep up with the “war tax” they demanded and was now hiding in her house\\n“My son? I don’t know. He’s not here,” Margarita responded coolly.\\nJose quietly ran into the back room, hopped out a window, and sprinted down the alleyway. He left the neighbourhood and did not come back.\\xa0\\n“I was standing there lying to them, but I just asked God to give me strength even though my heart was going ‘Thump, thump, thump,’” she says, pounding her chest.\\nHer deception worked. But the next day they were back with a threat: “You either hand him over or we’ll get rid of you to get back at him.”\\nThat was the breaking point. Margarita knew she had to leave. With just a small bag of clothes, the 72-year-old left before dawn, headed to the nearest bus station and left El Salvador for good. By that night, she was at a river marking the Mexico-Guatemala border, which she crossed on a makeshift raft.\\n“I didn’t know anything about Mexico when I came here,” she says. “I didn’t know anyone. I didn’t know I’d have to cross a river. I knew nothing!”\\nNone\\nAmong those seeking asylum in Mexico from the so-called Northern Triangle countries of Central America are more and more elderly people like Margarita, who face distinct challenges.\\n“Starting from scratch in a new country is difficult, but it can be particularly difficult for elderly refugees,” says Mark Manly, UNHCR’s representative in Mexico. “Many are pillars of their family and the community but others face particular problems because of illness or the wear-and-tear of old age.”\\nSince reaching Mexico in mid-2016, Margarita has been granted refugee status and is now a Mexican resident. Through financial support from UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, she has been able to pay rent and get groceries from a food bank.\\xa0\\n“I saw people my age just fall over and die in El Salvador. You live under so much stress all the time,” she says, noting the new lease on life that a fresh start\\xa0in southern Mexico has given her. “At 72, I feel young!”\\nWhile simple, her small, one-room house – with a slim mattress, a bedside lamp, and a small dresser - is nevertheless homely.\\xa0\\nTo keep herself busy, she helps out with child care for a young couple and their one-year-old daughter who live next door. She has also found part-time work as a housekeeper for another family nearby, which gives her enough income to get by, and she one day dreams of having a stall in the local market.\\nMeanwhile, Margarita is striving for something she did not have the chance to do in El Salvador: study. She left school at the age of eight but is now getting back into the classroom 64 years later.\\xa0\\n“I don’t know how to read much – only my bible – and I can’t write,” she says. “And I want to learn, now that the opportunity is in front of me!”\\nThrough a programme started by UNHCR and Mexico’s Secretariat of Public Education, Margarita and several other refugees who have missed out on schooling are studying two days a week to receive a primary school certificate.\\nAs the first class begins, Margarita – decades older than anyone else in the class – stands first to introduce herself.\\n“I am so grateful to be here,” she says. “We all have a great opportunity and I am so inspired seeing all the people who have come here and chosen to learn.”\\n*Name changed for protection reasons.Later, for lunch, she cooks ugali – an East African staple food made of flour and water – served with potatoes, beans, and meat sauce.

I decided not to give up, and to fight for their wellbeing.”\\nHer success is also something that UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, recognizes as key to its role of protecting and supporting over 450,000 refugees in DRC, including 36,000 from Burundi.\\nUNHCR is redoubling efforts to help them become self-reliant, providing training, startup funding and equipment. While in rural areas, this usually means gaining access to land and tools for farming, in cities the support is more focused on support for\\xa0small businesses. Urban refugees, many of whom already have some professional skills, learn how to draw up business plans, and gain the means to put them into practice.\\n“This investment can have enormous benefits, especially for vulnerable women.”\\n“This investment can have enormous benefits, especially for vulnerable women”, says Clementine Cremer, a Protection Officer with UNHCR in DRC. “We want to help them to meet their basic needs in situations where they have no other support.”\\nCremer said the women\\xa0often live in extreme poverty, far from home, without a\\xa0family network that protects them. In order to survive, they can resort to desperate measures, such as prostitution. “They easily become victims of exploitation and abuse,” she said.\\nOdette is among 71 heads of households in Goma – the breadwinners for over 300 \\xa0family members \\xa0– that UNHCR\\xa0has helped over the past three years with income-generating projects. \"When UNHCR decided to support us, I decided to take advantage of that and to start a new life,\" she says.\\nOdette believes she is an example both to\\xa0other refugees, whom she wants to follow in her footsteps, and to\\xa0their Congolese hosts. She dreams of opening a bigger restaurant – not one in a small shack but a really fancy one -- and then being able to send her children to university.\\nShe has earned more than money from her successful business. It has given her self-esteem and the certainty that she can provide for herself and her children in tough times. “Even when I feel things are not going well, I prefer to withdraw money from my savings account rather than to go to UNHCR and ask again for support.\"\\n*Name changed for protection reasons.“We were in the middle, with the army over there and the people who’d taken the land over here,” Bañol says, recounting shoot-outs between military forces and opportunists who took control of farms left behind by people fleeing the violence. “Who knows how many dead people are buried along that road.”\\nTwenty-four-year-old Bañol’s story is nothing special in this region, splayed around the wide and lazy Atrato River. Residents have suffered for generations as paramilitaries, left-wing guerrillas and government forces battled for control. Targeted killings of those who spoke out against armed groups were common, as were mass displacements, forced recruitments and sexual abuse, traumatizing each generation in turn.\\nLike many other young people in the region, near Colombia’s isolated and hard-to-reach northwestern border with Panama, Bañol wanted something different for the future.\\n“Once you’ve lived that experience you don’t want anyone else to have to go through it,” says Bañol. Her family is still fighting in court to get their land rights reinstated, allowing them to go home.\\n“Before there was a much higher number of young people joining armed groups, and that has gone down a lot.\"\\nShe and 139 other young area residents have found support for that desire for change through a first-of-its-kind programme backed by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency – the Inter-Ethnic Youth Leadership School.\\nNone\\nMany students, even those who live in local hub Riosucio, have had limited opportunities to go beyond secondary school. Most work with their families in subsistence farming or fishing, but the programme teaches them advanced policy-making skills, along with public speaking and leadership tools. This year a group of 20 students will present policy proposals to local municipal councils on everything from healthcare and education to sports programmes and security issues.\\n“Before there was a much higher number of young people joining armed groups, and that has gone down a lot because now they understand that there is a different way to confront their needs, problems and the lack of opportunities,” says Yaneth Velasco, UNHCR’s community-based protection assistant for the region, who runs the school’s meetings.\\nYurany Bañol, 24, attends the Inter-Ethnic Youth Leadership School in Colombia\\'s war-torn Chocó region. Her family was displaced repeatedly when she was growing up.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Julia Symmes Cobb\\nThe project is particularly relevant in Chocó, a remote province that has been hard hit by more than five decades of civil war. The conflict has uprooted some 7.3 million people within Colombia’s borders, and driven more than 340,000 refugees to seek safety abroad.\\nIt may seem optimistic to believe that a leadership school can help young people solve the myriad problems in Chocó. But Velasco says “the last four years have shown it’s possible, and that we are being ambitious but should keep betting on this process.”\\nThe students will need their newfound self-confidence and legal knowledge to navigate the region’s uncertain future. Following a peace deal with the government last year, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group has pulled out of the area. Many Chocó residents supported peace talks, and voted by large margins to back the accord between the FARC and the government. Yet many fear the power vacuum left by the rebels will embolden ruthless crime gangs.\\nAbsent large-scale government presence, illegal armed groups, many of whose members are former right-wing paramilitaries, have already begun to make inroads in previously FARC-controlled territory. These groups displaced over 2,200 people from their homes in Chocó in the first three months of this year, and there are reports of other violence.\\n“It’s a situation we foresaw,” says Velasco. “It’s very worrying and creates many risks for the population.” However, many communities are eager to host a school meeting, she says, because the presence of UNHCR gives them a measure of protection.\\nYair Moña, 19, a member of the Wounaan indigenous community, says the Inter-Ethnic Youth Leadership School has brought together indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities. \\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Julia Symmes Cobb\\nBeyond its ambitious goal of forging future leaders, the school is already helping to bring the ethnically diverse community closer together, giving students the opportunity to meet and form friendships with other young people from their region they might not otherwise ever have met. Though indigenous tribes like the Wounaan and Embera live near Afro-Colombian populations and have often suffered violence at the hands of the same perpetrators, there was very little contact across ethnic lines.\\n“Before the inter-ethnic school the indigenous and the Afro-Colombians didn’t understand each other,” says Yair Moña, 19, a member of the Wounaan community. “But the school has made an improvement, now we’ve shared things.”\\nThe oldest of 10 siblings, Moña’s young life was marked by displacement, something he would like to protect the Wounaan from in the future.\\n“I want to be the leader of my community and fight more to defend our land,” he says after the school’s most recent meeting in Riosucio, as his classmates flooded outside to mount motorbikes or board boats to take them back to their disparate communities.\\nUNHCR’s partner in the school, the Catholic Church’s Pastoral Social program, was key to making sure the efforts were separate from ethnic divisions.\\n“It is the duty of the church, which still has credibility with all the groups and is seen as impartial, to provide this service,” says Father Leonidas Moreno, a priest who has worked in the region for 37 years. “It’s not about evangelizing, what we want is a spirit of gathering together.”\\n“I want to be the leader of my community and fight more to defend our land.”\\n“It hasn’t been easy for the students to feel that now they can speak without fear,” Moreno says. “Before, that wasn’t possible – whoever spoke out, died.”\\nThe school is also offering government officials a glimpse of successful youth engagement in the most complicated of circumstances.\\n“It’s an innovative idea, especially because it reaches these difficult-to-access areas,” says Diego Fernando Mata, an official from Colombia Joven, the government youth affairs department. Mata came to Riosucio to advise students on their policy proposals.\\n“Our hope is to have a public policy for youth in Riosucio at the end of the year, built with young people, the state and other actors, which will help generate opportunities in employment, education, culture, sport, health,” Mata added. He encouraged students to propose changes that will make a quantitative impact in their communities, like reducing the number of teen pregnancies and increasing the number of places at secondary schools.\\nStudents have myriad ambitions – from community leader and social worker to lawyer and journalist. Bañol’s community already asked her to run for a municipal council position, but she declined, preferring to make change outside of notoriously corrupt political circles.\\n“Whatever I can do for my community I’ll do outside of politics,” says Bañol, who like many of the older students is already a parent, in her case to a five-year-old daughter. “I don’t want her to grow up in the same environment that I did.”The pair have found work with a sailmaker near the port of Kiel, repairing damaged sails and making sunshades, clothing and accessories from old sailcloth, poring over bolts of the hard-wearing fabric draped across wooden workbenches.\\nMohammed, who used to make curtains in Damascus, has adapted his skills to meet the demands of life on the Baltic coast. Together with his younger son, Yousef, he works full-time at Coastworxx, a textile workshop near the city.\\nMohammed was surprised how easily he made the switch to sewing sails. “I remember the first time we had a sail that had to be repaired,” said Mohammed, 51, speaking through a translator.\\n“I’d never done that before, but I just watched what the others did. The next one I did by myself. I was very glad to see I could do this job.”\\nGermany: Sailmaking workshop hires Syrian refugees\\nCoastworxx\\'s chief executive, sailmaker Christian Lübbe, was delighted to find so many enthusiastic and skilled textile workers among Kiel’s newest arrivals. His small workforce of nine now includes four asylum-seekers and refugees from Syria and Afghanistan.\\n“Mohammed and Yousef are much better than some of the Germans I’ve had as trainees,” Christian said. “We don’t need many words. Mohammed and I understand each other because he knows everything about the work. I just show him the designs and it works out.”\\n“We have a big chance with these guys to get these jobs done and keep these small companies going.”\\nGerman companies that rely on craft skills suffer from a labour shortage, he said.\\n“Now a lot of people have come here with the skills, who are able and willing. We have a big chance with these guys to get these jobs done and keep these small companies going.”\\nBoth sides benefit. For Mohammed and his family, who faced a long ordeal to reach and be reunited in Germany, finding work at Coastworxx has made a vital difference to their struggle to rebuild their lives.\\n“I’m so happy to have the work,” said Yousef, 23, who plans one day to set up his own workshop with Mohammed and his brother Ahmed. “It’s a very good thing for us to work. Also for Germany, I think. I’ve learned a lot from my father.”\\nAs a teenager in Damascus, Yousef often helped in his father’s workshop, where, besides curtains, they made bespoke light fittings, mosaics and tiles. As war closed in, Yousef, then 18, fled alone to Turkey to avoid being drawn into the fighting.\\nA year later, Ahmed followed. Then, only after many friends and his nephew had been killed, Mohammed also left in spring 2014, taking Yousef’s young sister Hanan and his mother, Soozanne.\\n“I worked so hard in Damascus, and then the war came,” said Mohammed, fighting back tears. “So many people were killed in Syria, every day. One day it will end. All wars have to end. But I’m sad because so many had to die. We’re just people. We just want to live.”\\nYousef (right), 23, lays out a boat cover he repaired with colleague Markus Hafner, 18, at the Coastworxx factory near Kiel, in northern Germany.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Gerhard Westrich\\nFrom Turkey, Mohammed and Ahmed decided to go on to Europe and send for the women once they were safe. They reached Greece on a flimsy rubber boat, paid smugglers to fly them to Switzerland, and then took a train to northern Germany.\\nYousef, meanwhile, took a different route. Working alone as a carpenter in Turkey, he saved enough money to travel to Italy. In late 2014, he boarded a boat, paying thousands of euros to smugglers and trusting them with his life.\\nHowever, disaster struck at sea. The smugglers turned on the 73 passengers, claiming they had not received their money, and said they would divert the boat elsewhere. Eleven days later, the boat arrived on the Egyptian coast.\\n“They know we’re just human beings who need help, that we just want to live without war.”\\nNone of the passengers, including Yousef, were carrying official documents. The group was arrested and taken to a police detention facility. The charges against them were dropped, but it was another eight months before they were released.\\n“You don’t know what that felt like, being in prison and not knowing what would happen,” Yousef said. “All my money was gone. Every day I asked myself, how do I get out?”\\nHe remained in contact with his family by phone, but they were unable to help him.\\nIn June 2015, delegations from Sweden, France and Germany agreed to resettle the prisoners to Europe. A relieved Yousef found himself on a flight to Germany, on his way to join his father and brother in Kiel. Soon afterwards, his mother and sister arrived from Turkey as part of a family reunification programme.\\nAbout this time, a chance meeting brought sailmaker Christian into contact with Mohammed, Yousef and Ahmed. After a trial period, Christian employed Mohammed and Yousef full-time in his workshop. Ahmed, 25, is planning to return to university.\\nMohammed shares a flat near the workshop with his 44-year-old wife and daughter Hanan, 15, who is in secondary school. Last autumn, Yousef also moved into his own place after initially living with a German host family.\\n“It’s really amazing – so many German people have helped us,” said Yousef, in the German he has learned from his student friends. He spends a lot of his free time with Christian and his family. “We eat together, we go for walks, we go surfing. We do a lot together. After living in the prison so long I wanted to think about positive things.”\\n“It’s very beautiful here, especially in summer,” he said. “Germany has become a second homeland for me. The people here are very good. Everyone here knows what has happened in Syria. They know we’re just human beings who need help, that we just want to live without war.”“I think of her every day,” he said with a sigh. “What can I do? Just go to my German classes and try to concentrate.”\\nNone\\n“Allowing families to be together will prevent dangerous, irregular journeys and improve their chances of integration. Happy people make good citizens,” said Christoph Pinter, head of the Austria office.\\nZiad has found safety and asylum in Austria, but is praying to be reunified with his bride, Kholoud, so they can resume their married life.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Gordon Welters\\nHowever, legal gaps and technical difficulties are keeping families apart.\\nUNHCR is concerned that, while those with full refugee status can apply for family reunification right away, those with “subsidiary protection” status must wait at least three years in Austria. This difference in treatment overlooks the fact that refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection share the same humanitarian needs.\\n“Allowing families to be together will prevent dangerous, irregular journeys … Happy people make good citizens.”\\nA practical obstacle means Ziad pines alone in Vienna while Kholoud is stuck in the Khan Al-Shih refugee camp near Damascus.\\nAustrian law says that family members must submit their applications for reunification within three months of a refugee receiving asylum. Kholoud missed the deadline through no fault of her own. Fighting between rebels and the Syrian army prevented her from leaving the camp and reaching Austrian consular officials in time.\\nUntil their case is resolved, Ziad and Kholoud keep their love alive by chatting on phone messaging apps WhatsApp and Viber.\\n“The nephews are like sons to me … There was no way I was going to leave them behind.”\\nAhmad Mansour, 36, a truck driver from Homs, in Syria, also depended on his smartphone to stay in touch from Austria with his family in Lebanon. So important was this contact for him – “we talked every hour, not just every day” – that he went without vital dental treatment so he could afford the phone.\\nThe Mansours are now together, living in the village of Gaweinstal in Lower Austria, but complications made reunification far from straightforward.\\nAhmad and his wife, Sara Al-Said, 31, are bringing up not only their own sons – Feras, 11, Nabil, 10 and Soheib, 3 – but also nephews Abdallah, 17, and Mostafa, 15.\\n“It was a romantic story,” Ahmad said. “The brothers of the Mansour family went courting the sisters of the Al-Saids. I married Sara while my brother, Mohamad, married Sara’s sister, Nadakh.”\\nTragically, Mohamad, Nadakh and their six-year-old son, Mussa, were killed in a bomb attack in Syria, leaving two surviving boys, Abdallah and Mostafa. Ahmad and Sara took in their nephews and treated them as their own children, but they had no adoption papers to prove this.\\n“The nephews are like sons to me,” Ahmad said. “I could not take ‘no’ for an answer. There was no way I was going to leave them behind.”\\nUnder Austrian law, only nuclear families – spouses and their children under the age of 18 – are eligible for reunification. Thanks to UNHCR mediation, a solution was found that respected the spirit of the law. The nephews were brought to Austria under a resettlement programme, while Sara and her sons came through regular family reunification channels.\\nAhmad came alone to Austria, via Turkey, Greece and the Balkans, in June 2015. The nephews arrived from Beirut in March 2016, followed by Sara and the sons in June 2016. A more inclusive understanding of what constitutes a family would have allowed for a swifter procedure.\\n“We were apart for a whole year,” says Ahmad. “I was going crazy but when the nephews arrived, I started to feel that everything was going to be OK.”\\nThe Mansours leave their extended family and many painful memories behind in Syria but their joy is clear as they walk in the evening through the lanes of the wine-growing village that is their new home.\\n“It’s too dangerous to go out. Except for buying groceries, she basically stays at home.\"\\n“I tell my children that, whatever we have been through, we must look forward now,” Ahmad said.\\nAhmad is looking for work. Sara, a psychology graduate and former teacher, is making good progress with German and all the children, except Abdallah, the eldest, go to school.\\nAbdallah, too old for school, dreams of becoming an actor. He shows me videos of his comic sketches, including one in which he pretends to chat to his girlfriend on the phone while washing his feet and smelly socks in a plastic bowl.\\nSuch harmless laughter and normal family life remain out of reach for Ziad and Kholoud. Both Palestinians, they were born in exile.\\n“The camp where we grew up in Syria was like a city,” he said. “I met Kholoud on the street there and I liked her. When we got married, we had 200 guests at the wedding.”\\nZiad left Syria in 2015 to join his father, already in Austria. Kholoud stayed with her parents and found herself trapped in Khan Al-Shih camp by the fighting. She is still in danger, and Ziad worries about her constantly.\\n“It’s as if she’s in prison,” he said. “It’s too dangerous to go out. Except for buying groceries, she basically stays at home. It is the same every time the regime takes over a place; the people are punished. Either the city becomes like a ghost town or the citizens live as if in prison.”\\nZiad said two of his cousins were kidnapped and later found dead, and other relatives were killed in attacks by government forces.\\nWhy did Ziad not take Kholoud with him when he set off for Europe?\\n“We could not afford the journey for two,” he said, adding that he would not want to subject her to the dangers of a hazardous sea crossing.\\n“The boat I was in overturned twice and we were rescued and sent back to Turkey, before the third attempt was successful. I thanked Allah then that Kholoud was not with me, as we narrowly escaped death.\\n“When she comes to Austria, I want her to fly in and I will go to the airport to meet her.”None\\nIt was no mean feat, coming in at a cost of Canadian $1.5 million. But he says the cascading events surrounding the war, coupled with a fear that he was not doing enough to help during a humanitarian crisis, prompted him to act.\\n“I do it because I believe in doing the right thing,\" he says. “And this is the right thing to do. You can’t stand by and do nothing.”\\n\"I do it because I believe in doing the right thing … You can’t stand by and do nothing.\"\\nAs Estill began to put his resettlement plans into practice, the local Islamic centre quickly became a close ally. Despite a busy schedule of caring for three children at home, Sara Sayyed was one of the volunteers who lent a hand. Her deft organizational skills soon led Estill to make her the ‘director of directors’ for the fledgling volunteer group. Before long, she was managing 800 volunteers. “It’s definitely a full time job,” she says.\\nMeet the Canadian businessmen who sponsored over 200 Syrian refugees\\nTogether, Estill and Sayyed realized that many refugees who arrive in Canada, after years of yearning for work and a steady income, need to learn English before venturing into the workforce.\\n“For many, it’s a difficult choice,” says Sayyed. “English class or getting a job. We asked ourselves – how can we do both?”\\nThe pair decided to see what would happen if the entrepreneurial itch was scratched. The result was a homegrown programme called Ease Into Canada – a way for refugees to earn a steady paycheck at Estill’s warehouse and learn on-the-job English.\\nEstill trained the new arrivals, trying to place them as close to their field as possible, all with the added benefit of immersion in a language-rich environment. Most worked on the warehouse floor assembling packaging, but others found work in accounting or IT systems.\\n“You\\'re not trying to create dependency,” says Estill. “You\\'re trying to work people to independence. Independence is being able to pay your own way. Paying your own rent, buying your own groceries – that is success.”\\nThe refugees gingerly navigated the noises and language of the warehouse floor, learning to be careful of forklifts and how to use the machinery.\\n“I promised myself and my family, we are going do everything we can here and maybe somebody will help us,” says Ahmad of his first days in Guelph. Soon, he had a full-time job. “When I started working, everyone knew me – I wasn\\'t a stranger. They knew my name. And right away, we are like brothers here. We work and we laugh together.”\\nPart of the success of the programme is location. For those fleeing the chaos of war, Guelph is a haven – a quiet city, often ranked as one of the best places in Canada to live. It has low crime rates, a mild climate and, most importantly, one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. Companies are hungry for new talent and the refugees fill an economic gap. Estill was able to utilize his business contacts, striking deals with other companies to take Syrian workers – for every translator provided, local companies would hire four employees.\\nAs the Syrians arrived, the community rallied and local storage space soon overflowed with donations. “We got so much stuff donated to the mosque that it soon became a fire hazard,” says Sayyed. “Bags and bags just showed up.\"\\n“Our community has drawn together because of this… The churches, the mosque, the synagogue and the Sikh temple – every group has helped.”\\nFaith was no barrier. “Our community has drawn together because of this,” says Estil. “I went to the churches, the mosque, the synagogue and the Sikh temple – every group has helped.”\\nEven after resettling 48 of the planned 58 families, donations continue. Volunteers navigate floor-to-ceiling stacks of mattresses, chairs, kitchenware and clothing. Brand new winter boots sit unworn in boxes. But Estill continues to eschew the spotlight, only agreeing to interviews with major networks in the hope that others might help out.\\nFiras al Mohammed, one of Guelph\\'s recent arrivals, will never forget Estill\\'s life-changing help.\\n“He picked me up from the unknown,\" he says. \"He led me to a clear future and stable life.”A thin concrete wall separates her from the hustle and bustle of Lebanon’s decades-old Palestine refugee camp in the southern suburbs of Beirut, which has received a new wave of refugees from Syria since the beginning of the country’s conflict in 2011.\\n\"I am embroidering a fish. It captures the story of a family’s dream to travel,” said Amina. “They have a little girl who is afraid of travelling. Why? Because she is scared she would drown in the sea and be eaten by the fish.’’\\nIn April last year, the Mousalli family – a Lebanese father, Syrian mother, and their daughters Marianne and Melina – decided to bring the stories and dreams of Syrian mothers in war-torn Aleppo closer to the world.\\n“Each doll holds the name of the person whose story it carries.\"\\nThrough a relative who remains in Syria, they collect the stories of ordinary Syrians, then turn them into sketches and have them embroidered onto cotton dolls by Syrian refugee women.\\n“Each doll holds the name of the person whose story it carries,” explained Marianne, as she held up one of the dolls. “This is Adreyeh. She comes from Aleppo. Her son Hassan dreams about rebuilding his house in his village. So we embroidered his dream house here.’’\\nEntitled ‘The Ana Collection’ – the word ‘Ana’ means ‘me’ in Arabic – the project seeks to address the hidden pain of Syrians who remain inside a country ravaged by war, through art and self-expression.\\nThe project has helped create a \"full circle of empowerment,\" says Marianne.\\n“Today most of what we see on TV is focused on the idea of a war in Syria,” explained Marianne. “We often forget that there are people who still live there, and that they have stories to tell. It’s not that people don’t care, but they see a big war, they don’t see individuals.”\\nThe project has brought out two collections: ‘From Inside Aleppo’ and ‘The Holiday Collection,\\' in which children from Aleppo expressed their wishes for Christmas. It is currently working on a third, ‘Stories from the Bekaa’, relating stories and dreams from refugees living in the Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon.\\n\"Many people buy these dolls for their children,” said Marianne. “When a child carries a doll named Hamida, his parents tell him \\'Hamida is your age, she wants to return to her house and play with her friends.\\' This makes it much easier to relate to.’’\\nLebanon is currently host to more than a million registered Syrian refugees, accounting for roughly a fifth of the total population. As a result, the small country has the highest proportion of refugees anywhere in the world.\\nIn addition to shining a light on some of the forgotten victims of the six-year war, the project has helped create a “full circle of empowerment,” says Marianne.\\n“People know that if they buy the doll Salma, they would be helping the real Salma back in Syria, and that the money they are paying is actually going to her. This touches them.”\\n“The project allows refugees to help other refugees and internally displaced people in Syria.\"\\nThe price for a doll ranges from US$25 to US$65, depending on its size. Proceeds are channeled back to the mothers and children behind the stories and in part cover the production costs and the compensation for the 80 women embroiderers in Lebanon.\\n“The project allows refugees to help other refugees and internally displaced people in Syria. They are keen on that,” Marianne added.\\nSyrian refugees in Lebanon, like Amina, have also found the project a good way to hone their skills and improve their sense of direction. “This is a good craft,” said Amina. “I taught it to my sister-in-law and niece, they embroider at home now.”\\nSince the project’s inception, over 1,500 dolls with 48 stories have been sold in countries including Lebanon, Kuwait, France and Australia. The tag on each doll carries a message that Marianne says they work towards every day, in the name of all Syrian mothers: “I protect the dreams of my children.”“All of my family – my parents, my grandparents, my great grandparents – were born and died in El Salvador,” she says, and then shakes her head. “But that all ended over a US$5,000 extortion.”\\nIt all began in mid-2015, when one of Maria Luz’s sons-in-law received a demand for a cash payment, the so-called “war tax” imposed by El Salvador’s brutal street gangs. He could not pay, so they murdered him.\\n“We were living like animals, locked in the house, only ever opening the door to run out and get food.\"\\nThe next threat fell on her daughter, 42-year-old Sandra Felicitas Perez. The price to keep her family and business safe: US$5,000, an impossible sum. Sandra, her husband and her three teenage children were terrified.\\n“We were living like animals, locked in the house, only ever opening the door to run out and get food,” she says.\\nAfter a few weeks living in siege-like conditions, her 19-year-old daughter, Maria Luz – namesake of her grandmother – braved it out to the family’s shop. She was in her first year of college but still insisted on helping the family business. The gang was waiting, and as soon as she stepped out, they coldly shot the pretty, young girl inside the store.\\nMexico: A fresh start after fleeing El Salvador\\'s gangs (Cinthya Chavez, camera/ Herminia Fernandez, producer)\\n“When I heard, it destroyed my life,” says Sandra, pulling up a picture on her mobile phone of Maria Luz with her two brothers, all wearing goofy smiles. “Two days later, we buried her and then fled. I knew if we didn’t leave they would kill us all.”\\nIn July 2015, with just a few pieces of clothing and as much cash as they could get together, they headed north for Mexico with Sandra’s younger sister, Carla, and her two teenage daughters.\\n\"Two days later, we buried her and then fled. I knew if we didn’t leave they would kill us all.”\\nBy this time, the extortions and threats had rippled out through the Perez family. Sandra’s nephew and his family of four had fled weeks earlier and were already applying for asylum in Mexico. And still the killings mounted.\\nAt just 14, Maria Luz’s favourite grandson, Rodolfo Antonio, was gunned down by a gang member who wanted his Puma sneakers. Three months later, the eighth grader’s mother, Sara del Carmen, was shot by the same gang.\\nNow, the 17 surviving members of the Perez family all live on the same block in a small town in southern Mexico. Thanks in part to financial support from UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, each branch of the family is able to afford its own little house.\\nNone\\nUNHCR expects asylum applications in Mexico to more than double in 2017 to over 20,000. And many, like the Perez family, are increasingly leaving in large family groups.\\n“We’re seeing more and more large families requesting asylum in Mexico,” says Mark Manly, UNHCR’s representative in Mexico. “We’re working to make sure these family units can stay together and support each other through the traumatizing dislocations from their homes.”\\nThe transition to Mexico has been painful for Maria Luz. She suffers from an array of health problems: she can barely see, her knees are swollen to the size of small melons, and she has high blood pressure and heart problems.\\n“We’re working to make sure these family units can stay together and support each other.\"\\nBut she is surviving – what remains of the Perez family is – because they are together.\\n“I take care of my mother because all of her conditions make life very difficult,” says Ana Ruth, another of Maria Luz’s daughters. “I also care for the kids and grandkids when others in the family go out to work.”\\nThey help each other out and make what money they can to survive. Maria Luz’s daughter Carla works 12-hour shifts at a tortilla shop, where she earns just US$5 per day. Sandra runs a small shop out of her house and daily profits fluctuate around the same level. Ana Ruth’s husband, Pablo, makes US$10 per day working for a local mechanic. He was able to get his two sons-in-law and his nephew jobs at the repair shop too.\\n“You feel safer being with your family,” says Sandra. She reaches out to grab her son Jose, her only living child. He is working at the repair shop and hopes to one day to attend university in Mexico.\\n“I want others to know us as people who tried hard, who gave it our all,” he says. He bursts into tears. “That’s how we can honour our family who died.”Tonight is Syrian night and chef Aziz, 29, is hard at work putting the finishing touches to dishes from back home in Damascus.

They are looking forward to discovering different culinary traditions and coming together as a community, with food and culture the unifying factor.\\n“This food sends me right back to Damascus.\"\\nFadi is in charge of the dessert, a sweet honey-infused pastry called baklava.\\nHis longing for Syrian desserts and other tastes of home prompted him to learn how to make them via the Internet. “Let me know what you think,” he says with pride, as he serves the baklava to eager customers.\\n“I actually didn’t know how to make this before I came to Switzerland,” he confesses. “I looked it up on YouTube!”\\nThe event is organized by Cuisine Lab, the brainchild of entrepreneur Dan Stein, 43.\\nDan, an American who lives in Geneva, was inspired to set up the venture after he volunteered for a similar venture with friends last year in Athens. Touched by this first-hand experience of the refugee crisis, he believed the city lacked opportunities for cross-cultural understanding and dialogue between the newcomers and the local population.\\nA chef puts the final touches to the baklava while participants serve themselves.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Vi Tran\\nDan and some friends decided that a kitchen project was just what Geneva needed. Having already been involved in many innovative initiatives, he calls Cuisine Lab his “labour of love”.\\n“The words ‘company’ and ‘companion’ come from the Latin word ‘companio’, the one you share your bread with,\" he says.\\n“The act of sharing food, or bread, has a long history of creating connections when people don’t necessarily share language or culture. By cooking together, and by sharing food, we take a first step in trying to find that common connection.”\\nCuisine Lab organizes a variety of events: social cooking evenings, where a theme is chosen and people bring ingredients and cook together, pop-up kitchens where refugees, asylum seekers and amateur cooks prepare their ethnic dishes and share it with the community, and cooking workshops where people are given the opportunity to learn from, and cook with, the chefs in the community.\\n\"The act of sharing food, or bread, has a long history of creating connections.\"\\nIn the kitchen, Afghan asylum-seeker Islam, 31, has joined the Syrian chefs and is observing and helping out. In a few weeks, it will be his turn to take charge of the space for Afghan night. He shows a photo on his phone of himself cooking next to the Afghan flag at a university event in Geneva.\\n“Cooking is my passion in life,” he says.\\nIslam is living with other asylum seekers in an underground Swiss civil defence shelter near Geneva. The conditions are sometimes difficult; he is not able to cook for himself, has to sleep with the lights on and must endure the noisy environment. Still, Islam is optimistic about the future. “I want to one day open my own restaurant,” he says.\\nWhile he waits for a decision on his asylum application, Islam is happy to have found a community where he can share his passion for cooking.Then, when war broke out in Syria in 2011, he was forced to flee his hometown of Kobane for Lebanon, where he tried once again to get a university degree – this time juggling four jobs to pay for his tuition and make ends meet.\\n“I worked in elevator maintenance, as a porter, and painter, and as an extra on Lebanese and Syrian films and TV shows,” he recalls.\\nThe 31-year-old’s struggle to get a college degree is all-too-common among Syrian refugees in Lebanon, only one-in-eight of whom manage to enroll in further education.\\nNone\\nOnly one-in-eight of the Syrian refugees in Lebanon manage to enroll in further education.\\nSince its inception in 1992, the DAFI programme has grown considerably, enabling over 2,240 refugee students annually to study at universities and colleges in 41 countries of asylum in 2014. In Lebanon, 315 students are currently benefiting from the scholarships.\\nBut for most young refugees the hurdles to accessing higher education remain formidable. When Syrian student Mariam, 23, fled Damascus four years ago, she already had a baccalaureate in science under her belt and firm plans to continue her studies upon her return to Syria.\\n“I was convinced that we were not going to stay in Lebanon for more than 15 days, a month at most,” says Mariam. “But those who left the neighbourhood were soon forbidden from re-entering it, the whole area was besieged.”\\nMariam spent the next two years in Lebanon giving private tuition to two school children. “My father is disabled and my mother could not find a job. I was too worried about my family and could not afford to study and work at the same time.”\\nNone\\nIn Lebanon, over a third of DAFI beneficiaries have said that they do not have time to study due to pressure at home to work and support their families, according to a 2016 assessment.\\nMariam never gave up on her dream of a college education. One year into her stay in Lebanon, she realized that to be able to apply to universities, she needed to retrieve her baccalaureate certificate from Damascus – something she had not considered when she and her family fled Syria.\\n“I did everything I could to have a relative get my certificate, but to no avail. It was stuck at Damascus University where I initially enrolled and needed a governmental decision to be released.”\\nAgatha Abi Aad, an assistant education officer with UNHCR, explains that the lack of administrative documents, including education certificates from prior studies, is one of the many hurdles facing Syrian youths who wish to enrol in university.\\n“The universities now issue a paper upon registration, before official enrolment, that helps students obtain temporary residency, which is a key requirement for university enrolment. But the majority of refugees in Lebanon are unable to pay the yearly renewal fee of US$200,” says Abi Aad.\\n“I am helping Syrian children because I fear they might not get another chance to get an education.\"\\nThe Government of Lebanon last month announced that Syrian refugees registered with UNHCR can now renew their residency permits free of charge – a change warmly welcome by refugees as well as by UNHCR, which has long advocated for the waiver of renewal fees.\\nWhen Mariam learned about DAFI in 2015, she immediately applied and got selected. She hired a lawyer with the help of a distant relative still living in Syria and managed to get a copy of her baccalaureate certificate. She meticulously followed the necessary steps to register at Lebanese University. She endorsed her certificate at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and headed to the Ministry of Education to get the equivalence.\\n“No valid residency means no equivalence,” the clerk told her. At that moment, Mariam felt like she had hit a brick wall. “I had to pay US$600 in fines for having overstayed my residency,” she said. Mariam is hoping that the most recent policy change will allow her to pursue her dream and continue her education.\\nShe now volunteers as a teacher for Syrian children with Save the Children. “I am helping Syrian children now because I fear they might not get another chance to get an education,” she explains.\\nFor now, though, Mariam’s dream of continuing her own education remains on hold.The fashion world elite casting an eye over this year’s ready-to-wear styles at the renowned fashion house enjoyed specialities such as baba ganoush, fattoush, kibbeh and baklava.\\nThe event was the latest to showcase the skills of a man who was once prosperous and well-known in his home country before civil war drove him and his family to flee to safer shores.\\nLast June, Mohammad cooked with French chef Stéphane Jégo as part of the French capital’s Refugee Food Festival. The pair devised a new style of cooking at the Left Bank restaurant l’Ami Jean, where Jégo is the chef and owner, combining French and Syrian recipes.\\nKenzo had heard about Mohammad and contacted the Refugee Food Festival. He was selected to cook at the catwalk show after a competing with another chef.\\nHe has also cooked at receptions at the Palais de Tokyo Museum and at Paris City Hall for an event attended by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo.\\nIt is a far cry from the life he led just a few years earlier, when he owned several restaurants and appeared regularly on cooking shows on television in Syria and Dubai. He bought a house for his family in 2011 and was able to pay for the education of his three sons. He and his wife Doha, a teacher, enjoyed a happy family life.\\nThen conflict erupted in Syria in 2011, turning his world upside down. “We started to hear the dangerous stories,” Mohammad said. “We saw people dying, people moving out of homes.”\\n“We thought we would come back. We thought it would take only a few days, months maybe.”\\nAs thousands, then millions, fled, they joined the exodus. They took just a few clothes and personal belongings and the limited amount of cash, US$400, they were allowed to withdraw from the bank and left for Lebanon. They were sure they would return soon. Their youngest son, Adam, was just three months old.\\n“We took a bag, gold jewels I had bought to my wife,” Mohammad said. “We thought we would come back. We thought it would take only a few days, months maybe.”\\nThey were unaware at the time that it was just the beginning of their journey in exile.\\nBelieving they would be safer In Egypt, he went there alone to try to start a restaurant. After a period of separation while he tried to establish a business, his family joined him, but he and Doha decided to try to make a new start in Europe after his restaurant venture was thwarted by a series of misfortunes.\\nAfter a gruelling, 12-day journey on an overcrowded boat heading from Alexandria to Italy, they were picked up thanks to the Italian government’s Mare Nostrum search-and-rescue operation.\\n“I was looking for the safety of my children,” Mohammad said. “They had many questions. Adam was telling me that he wanted an apple. Every time he asked me, I cried. I cried every night, but I had my wife, Doha, my lifetime friend. She supported me.”\\nHe was full of praise for the welcome they received in Italy. “We looked like homeless. We were homeless. Many people came to help. A very old man gave us food. In the bag, there was an apple I gave to Adam.”\\nEventually they reached France, where they were granted refugee status in 2015.\\n“Paris was my dream place to work. Paris is the mother of service, cuisine, the famous capital of hospitality, fashion, food, gastronomy. If you put Paris on your CV, you are a professional. This is what we say in Arab countries.”\\nThey were housed at a reception centre in Savigny-sur-Orge, on the outskirts of Paris, where they waited for their asylum application to be granted. Mohammad gave cooking lessons to the social worker assigned to his case, Carole. “She taught me how to speak French, I taught her how to cook.”\\nCarole told him about an organization called “les Cuistots Migrateurs” (“the migrant chefs”), a venture created by French entrepreneurs Louis Jacquot and Sébastien Prunier, who are trying to change the way Parisians view immigrants by introducing the French to the best of the newcomers’ home cuisines.\\nThe pair tracked down trained chefs among the thousands of people granted asylum in France. They then gathered a small group to form a catering company specializing in lesser-known cuisines.\\n“Syria is my love, my mother, my wife. I can’t find the words to tell you what Syria means for me. But today, we cannot return.”\\nThe group provided most of the chefs that took part in the Refugee Food Festival, including Mohammad, who was one of the first to join the project. Eleven restaurants in Paris opened their kitchens to chefs from Syria, Sri Lanka, Chechnya, Iran and India for the event.\\n“What I like more in cooking is the very first taste, when people say ‘mmmm’,” Mohammad said.\\nHis children – Adam, now aged 6, and his brothers Omar, 13, and 10-year-old Ziad – speak French fluently and attend school in Paris. Doha, 36, hopes she can return to teaching. Mohammad’s mother, whom he hadn’t seen for four years, obtained a visa and joined them a few weeks ago, reuniting the family once again.\\nHe said he wanted to learn as much about France as he could, and also to share his culture and use his talents “to live in harmony with the people who have welcomed us.”\\nHowever, Mohammad still dreams of going back to Syria.\\n“Syria is my love, my mother, my wife.

At age 18, she is a year younger than the Pakistani activist, who escaped an assassination attempt after defying Taliban bans on girls going to school.\\nMalala\\'s story spread around the world and inspired millions of people. But it might have passed Dekow by if not for an innovative initiative called Instant Network Schools, or INS, which brought online education and connectivity into her refugee camp school.\\nSelected schools and community centres are kitted out with a \"digital box\" that includes a set of computer tablets, solar-powered batteries, a satellite or mobile network, and a suite of content and online learning material. Teachers receive IT support and ongoing training.\\n“We hear from students and teachers that the programme has increased motivation on both sides.\"\\nSince the initial pilot in Dadaab in 2014, the programme has been taken up by 31 centres in four countries in the region: Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\\nIt grew organically from a partnership between UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and the Vodafone Foundation, which had been working in schools in Dadaab. Seeing the huge gaps in resources and connectivity in the camp highlighted how mobile technology could improve the quality of education in such remote areas.\\nNone\\nIn Africa, which hosts more displaced people than anywhere apart from the Middle East, millions of refugee students are struggling to catch up with their education. Innovations like INS help to provide as much continuity in their education as possible.\\nEven when they are at school, refugee children in Africa often learn in extremely tough conditions, in overcrowded classes with limited resources. UNHCR, through programs like INS, is helping to bridge some of these gaps and reaching thousands of students like Dekow.\\n“Learners understand best what they see, rather than what they hear, and we used to hear about lots of things that we never knew,” she says. “But when the tablets arrived, even our teachers were wondering at how we were participating. We are in a position to respond to difficult questions without even going back to our notes.”\\nJacqueline Strecker, the Learn Lab Manager at UNHCR Innovation, says the idea is to take a holistic approach bringing technology into the classroom. \"We wanted to use it to help improve teaching through higher access to relevant teaching material and up-to-date information that teachers could use, and add educational videos and pictures for students into the mix.\"\\n“It taps into UNHCR\\'s commitment to ensure high-quality education by enhancing classrooms.\"\\nShe adds: “It taps into UNHCR\\'s commitment to ensure high-quality education by enhancing classrooms and having refugees benefit from digital material. We hear from students and teachers that the programme has increased motivation on both sides. Teachers are also more excited to come to schools, and they feel like they are supported.\"\\nGadafi Mohamed, a teacher in Hagadera camp in Dadaab, highlights the additional interest stirred by having Information Communication and Technology, or ICT, in the classroom. “Before we embraced ICT, many learners were not even coming for classes because of lack of interest,” he says.\\n“Since we started using ICT there have been a number of improvements. It is basically visualizing things other than teaching from the textbooks, and the students have really developed their interest.”\\nNone\\nAfrica Shares: Innovation transforming refugee lives\\nProjects include Malian refugee artisans in Burkina Faso, a children’s reading initiative in Ethiopia, a Rwandan energy-saving stove project, a Zimbabwean poultry project, a Malawian Microsoft connectivity scheme, and urbanization and subsidized gas initiatives in Niger.\\nWhat cuts across all of these projects is the community-based approach that UNHCR and partners have taken. Refugees are central to each, and they can exercise their existing skills while learning new ones.\\n\"UNHCR’s greatest asset is the fact that we’ve got communities that are highly resilient and very creative,” says Strecker. “Allowing them to use their creativity to take charge of such projects and own them is what’s really important.”\\nEqually important is the fact that refugees in Africa are inspired to use innovation to create home-grown solutions. For Dekow, innovation has not only enhanced her education experience, it has motivated her to be like her role model.\\n\"UNHCR’s greatest asset is the fact that we’ve got communities that are highly resilient and very creative.”\\n“Malala told us to speak up,” she says. “I thought that she had a great message because her message and my dream correspond to each other.

Like Mohamed, hundreds of Syrians who fled the conflict at home came a long way to seek refuge in Mauritania, before the government imposed visa restrictions on them in early 2016. However, many now struggle to make a living here due to lack of employment opportunities, and health care and education gaps.\\nAlso among them is Talal. Before the war, he was an architect in Syria. In Mauritania, he has been working as a casual worker at a restaurant. “The house I built for my family in Homs does not exist anymore,” he says, his voice trailing off and his gaze becoming distant. For Talal\\'s family, who share one of the small buildings in Nouakchott’s outskirts with another Syrian family just so they can pay the rent, resettlement to Finland comes as a great relief.\\n“We just want to find peace.\"\\nUNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has expressed growing concern for Syrians in Mauritania.\\n“Desperate Syrians are at high risk of attempting perilous journeys in the hope to reach Europe and can easily become victims of people smugglers here in the Sahel,” says UNHCR’s Mohamed Alwash. “In Mauritania last year, we received reports of a few Syrian families crossing into neighbouring unstable northern Mali with the intention to reach Europe through the most dangerous Saharan routes. For this reason, UNHCR has set up an outreach programme to inform the Syrian community on their rights as refugees and provide them with basic assistance.”\\nWith no possibility to return to Syria, resettlement to third countries is sometimes the only durable solution. The brutal war in Syria is now approaching a tragic sixth anniversary. Alongside the hundreds of thousands killed or maimed in the fighting, 4.9 million people have sought refuge in neighbouring countries and a further 6.3 million have been displaced within Syria’s borders.\\nFormer businessman and father-of-four Abu Bashir used to travel between Morocco and Syria, selling mattresses for a factory back home. But after his house in Aleppo was destroyed by an air strike in 2013, he had no option but to flee to Nouakchott with his family. “All my kids suffer from a genetic condition that cannot be treated here,” he says, holding up a picture of his elder son who has a brain malformation and learning difficulties.\\nDespite his business experience and contacts, Abu Bashir now works as a shoe retailer and struggles to make ends meet for his family. “We get both medical and school assistance for the kids from UNHCR, but the problem is that they need a special assistance that we cannot find in this country. Me, I am already 50 years old, I have no hope. But my future is my children and my family. I just wish they can live a normal life.\"\\n\"The house I built for my family in Homs does not exist anymore.\"\\nAbu Bashir is hopeful that his family will be resettled as well. Meanwhile, he will never forget the lifeline that Mauritania offered to them at their darkest hour.\\nSyrian father of four and lab specialist Nadim, his wife and children lived in Aleppo until war forced them to flee in 2012. He knew some colleagues were already safe in Mauritania so, in October 2013, Nadim made the difficult decision to leave his family behind and board a plane to Nouakchott.\\n“I found it very hard here initially,” recalls Nadim. “I had left my family behind as I was looking for a safe place for them, but here I found no job and I was so far away from home. Communications were interrupted because of the conflict so I was living with the fear that something might happen to my wife and children. I used to cry all the time.”\\n\"My future is my children and my family. I just wish they can live a normal life.\"\\nNone\\nAt last, with the promise of a safe and stable family life, Nadim can look forward to the future once more. “I was once told by a Mauritanian singer that when you arrive in Mauritania you cry, but when you leave it you cry twice,” he says. “I cannot describe my feelings now that I am finally leaving the country that welcomed us in such a harsh moment.”\\nNone\\n* Some names have been changed for protection reasonsStanding off to one side and watching the other children is Wafaa Keyari, an eight-year-old girl from the battered Sakhour district of eastern Aleppo. Wafaa doesn’t spend much time with the other children because of the way she looks. An explosion two years ago destroyed her home and severely burned her body and face.\\n“We had a gas cylinder in our home,” she explains. “When the house was shelled, the gas cylinder exploded. I was next to it. My father and I got burned and a man died.”\\n\"When the house was shelled, the gas cylinder exploded. I was next to it.\"\\nWafaa has thus far survived the brutal war in Syria, which is now approaching a tragic sixth anniversary. Alongside the hundreds of thousands killed or maimed in the fighting, 4.9 million people have sought refuge in neighbouring countries and a further 6.3 million have been displaced within Syria’s borders.\\nWearing a bright purple scarf and a green woolen hat that hides the scars on her scalp, Wafaa smiles shyly and bobs up and down as she describes the immediate aftermath of the explosion.\\nSyria: A young girl scarred by war\\n“I was taken to hospital. I was awake and they treated me,” she recalls. “You know I was wearing wool clothes, like the ones I am wearing now, they got stuck to me. When they took me to the hospital, they were pulling them off my skin. It hurt so much, they didn’t even use anesthetic – they just pulled it off.”\\nHomeless, Wafaa, her parents and seven older siblings went to live with nearby relatives in east Aleppo. But as the four-year battle for Syria’s second city reached its destructive climax at the end of last year, the family fled in search of safety and came to the shelter in western Aleppo where they have lived for the past four months.\\nThe historic city is calm for now, following a truce that saw the evacuation of armed groups and citizens trapped in conflict areas. But years of conflict have changed it beyond recognition.\\nOf the estimated 4 million former inhabitants of the city, fewer than 1.5 million remain. Thousands died, and many more are now refugees abroad. Wafaa and her family are among 400,000 people displaced within the city.\\nOn a recent visit \\xa0there, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi was shocked by the level of destruction.\\n“There is very little that one can say –\\xa0these ruins speak by themselves,” he said. “When you see children’s clothes hanging out of windows, kitchens cut in half by shells and rockets, real lives of people interrupted by war as it was happening\\xa0–\\xa0I think this will weigh very heavily on the conscience of the world for generations.”\\nAround 40 per cent of the city is destroyed beyond repair, and many other parts of Syria have suffered a similar fate. Twelve of the 18 neighborhoods in the city of Homs now form an apocalyptic landscape of flattened, bullet-ridden tower blocks and houses. They are devoid of any sign of life beyond the sounds of birds and the green shoots of plants beginning to grow out of the rubble.\\n“I think this will weigh very heavily on the conscience of the world for generations.”\\n“We must think that there are people here, some are returning to these ruins who need help, immediate help,” Grandi said. “They are cold, they are hungry, they need to work to earn some money. They need the elementary things of life.”\\nWith no home to return to, Wafaa’s family must remain in their temporary shelter for now, surviving on the aid they receive from UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and NGO partners. Despite everything, there is one bright spot for Wafaa. Fighting in Aleppo prevented her from starting school, but now she is enrolled in classes set up by NGOs at the shelter.\\nIn the past month, Wafaa has also been to see doctors in Damascus, who are considering plastic surgery to repair some of the scarring. How much they can do is uncertain, but Wafaa is excited by the mere possibility. “I want to get better, and be happy in life and not be in need of anything,” she says.\\nWafaa says she still remembers how she used to look before the explosion. Asked whether the incident had changed her at all, she paused for a moment before replying with a smile: “No. I am still the same nice girl.“We want self-reliance for ourselves and we want to be able to support our children,” says Jamila, proudly. “Now we have a proper business where we sell high quality milk.”\\nThe tin-roofed start-up at the camp, 70 kilometres from the border with Somalia\\xa0in southern Ethiopia, buys up goat, cow and camel milk from local herders.\\nSupported by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and its partners,\\xa0the project provides both a service to the camp and local community and a living for the 20 Somali women who work there, testing, pasteurizing and storing the milk in solar-powered refrigerators for resale.\\n“We want self-reliance for ourselves and we want to be able to support our children.”\\n“Now we have the cooperative and the partners on our side, we have a proper business,” Jamila says.\\nIt is not the first time Jamila has sold milk. Back in Somalia, before conflict forced the couple and their eight children to flee for Ethiopia in 2010, she and her husband had worked as farmers and pastoralists.\\n“In Somalia, women are the ones who care for the cattle. All my life I have been selling milk, transporting it from our farm all the way to the border. I am happy I found a livelihood here that I am used to,” she says.\\nAfter just a few visits from farmers, Jamila and the other 19 women have enough milk to sell. In a good day, they can earn up to 540 Ethiopian Birr – equivalent to US$26 – part of which they plough back into the business.\\n“We save some of the money, use some of it to buy goods, and then collect the rest in a pot, as part of our tradition, which is then assigned to each one of us by turns,” says Nuria Hassen, another member of the cooperative. “This is our way of supporting each other,” she adds.\\nThe group pasteurizes the milk by slowly heating it – a process which kills potentially harmful microbes, while conserving its nutritional qualities. “We are known for our quality milk and we would like to keep it that way for our business to prosper,” says Nuria, holding up a thermometer that is\\xa0part of the dairy’s milk processing kit.\\nThe women have quickly taken ownership of the initiative and, together, they form a powerful unit. “It is in our culture that the women stick together,” says Jamila. “All women in the world should come together so they can thrive as one. A woman who does not work cannot even have a cup of tea.”\\nEthiopia has been a generous host to Somali refugees since they began arriving in the early 1990s, following the fall of Siad Barre\\'s regime in Somalia. UNHCR and partners including the IKEA Foundation have supported the enterprise since 2015, providing training and equipment for the dairy, which is seen as a benefit to the whole local community.\\n“The refugee women do not only become empowered and earn income, they also contribute to the refugee and Ethiopian community.”\\n“Through this business, the refugee women do not only become empowered and earn income, they also contribute to the refugee and Ethiopian community by introducing a quality and safe product into the market,” explains Aurthur Mutambikwa, a UNHCR livelihoods officer in Melkadida.\\nAs five o’clock comes around, the women have sold their stock and they head home to their families. Any leftover milk is stored in the solar-powered refrigerator to sell the next day.\\nThe theme of International Women’s Day – which is today – is forging a better, more equitable working world, in which women\\'s right to decent work becomes a reality. For these Somali women, the cooperative has brought some cherished dreams within reach.\\n“I want all of us to be self-reliant and our business to expand so we can support our children,” says Jamila. “I was forced to leave everything behind when the conflict reached my home town back in 2010 in Somalia. Here, I have found peace and a new beginning – here is where I want to stay. With all these opportunities, we are on the right path.”\\nNoneEven now, months after he and his family moved into a nearby apartment, the Syrian electrician returns to the site every day to help, as\\xa0UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and its partners improve accommodation for 900 remaining residents.\\n“We lost our lives, we need to start again to see a good future,” said Mohamed, 44, a father of four from Al-Sabinah, south of Damascus. “We don’t want to wait without anything to do. We need to work, we need to be something in this world.”\\nMohamed started volunteering last summer with Dutch NGO Movement on the Ground\\xa0when he spotted workmen measuring the ground. They told him they were installing cables to bring solar power to the camp. Keen to make use of his skills, he asked if he could help.\\n“I told them, ‘Perfect, I am an electrician, can I help? I am available, I will start today’,” he said. Most days, he and his brother Moufeed, 34, have been hard at work first volunteering to help lay underground cables, then to install solar panels.\\nSince January, Mohamed has been helping Movement on the Ground and UNHCR\\xa0with a wider operation to assist authorities install prefabricated houses at Kara Tepe. He and Moufeed volunteer with the Dutch NGO to\\xa0help connect the new units to the solar panels and disconnect empty refugee housing. To date, UNHCR has installed 150 residential containers in municipality-run Kara Tepe, with a further 142 still to come.\\n“It’s better for my children here,” said Horia Khalil, 35, a Syrian asylum-seeker and mother of three. “There’s more space than in the other shelter.”\\nShe and her family have lived in Kara Tepe since September and moved into one of the new prefabs eight weeks ago.\\n“I have many friends there from all over the world. I can speak to many people, help with the work and learn.”\\nThe change has benefitted her seven-year-old daughter who suffers nightmares and anxiety after the ordeals of war-torn Aleppo, their home town. “Thank God we are safe,” she said. “But my children are still afraid of the bombs, I worry about them.”\\nSince January, UNHCR has transferred more than 1,000 people from a government-run site at Moria to the Kara Tepe camp and into apartments and hotels. That figure includes all families, unaccompanied children and most single women. UNHCR is now transferring another 130 women from Moria, where they are housed in their own cordoned-off area.\\nIn Kara Tepe, Mohamed’s work goes on. In October, he and his family moved out of the facility into a private apartment operated by UNHCR’s local partner Iliaktida in the nearby town of Mytilene. However, he was keen to carry on his volunteering work in the site.\\n“I love to be in Kara Tepe,” he said. “Now if I don’t go there I miss it,” he added in English he learned from volunteers during his seven months in the facility. “Every day I want to go there. I have many friends there from all over the world. I can speak to many people, help with the work and learn.”\\nFor Mohamed’s wife Maysoum, who suffers from back and neck pain, life in the apartment is a great improvement. She is happy the whole family, including the couple’s four young children, have been granted refugee status and a three-year Greek visa. “We are safe now,” said Maysoum, 37. “But I still worry about the future, for the children.”\\n“This is the place for me. Now it’s a new life, a new future, for me, for my wife, for my children.”\\nThe couple’s two eldest daughters Alissar, 9, and Limar, 7, are old enough to remember the harrowing journey from Syria to Greece via Turkey last spring. Mohamed said they were shot at crossing borders and had to sleep outside in the rain for nights on end.\\n“It was for the children we decided to leave,” said Mohamed, whose home town was devastated during the Syrian conflict. “We couldn’t go back to where we’re from.” The family had intended to travel to Germany, where two of Mohamed’s brothers and a sister live. However, arriving on Lesbos in April last year, they heard the West Balkan route was closed and decided to abandon their onward journey.\\nUnfazed by this set-back, Mohamed arrived in Kara Tepe and set about improving his surroundings. First, he put up a swing on a tree for his children. Next, he transformed the stony ground outside his shelter into a vegetable patch. Movement on the Ground provided soil, tools and seeds. Before long, green beans, courgettes, onions, herbs and watermelons were springing up from the once-bare earth.\\n“I loved to see it grow up every day,” said Mohamed, who tended an allotment at home in Syria. “It’s good for your mind if you go to sleep waiting for tomorrow, to see how the garden has grown. Every day you are curious to see what happens in the garden. It made me happy.”\\nMohamed also strove to make Kara Tepe better for everyone. During the seven months he lived there, he became a kind of community leader, bringing residents together for weekly meetings outside his tent to discuss their concerns with the shelter operators.\\n“I put tables and chairs for people outside where I stayed,” he said. “They could sit and speak together about how to make Kara Tepe better, more beautiful.”\\nIt’s partly his enthusiasm for this work that makes Mohamed want to stay on the island long term. Daughters Limar and Alissar have started school and are rapidly picking up Greek. The couple has another daughter, Elian, 5, and a 3-year-old son, Baraa.\\nMohamed is also studying the language and hopes soon to find paid work as a handyman, plumber and electrician.\\n“Now on the island we are happy,” he said. “It’s safe for my wife, for my children. I can go to work for the day and come back without worrying about them. This is the place for me. Now it’s a new life, a new future, for me, for my wife, for my children.”“The doctors told me it’s better on the mainland because my son will need more medical help,” explained Falak, 40, who has been moved with her sons to a government-run shelter in the Greek city of Larissa.\\nFalak and her family are among thousands of asylum-seekers who, with UNHCR’s help, have moved from the Aegean islands to the mainland, where better accommodation and facilities are available. Since June, UNHCR has supported the transfer of 5,556 people into government-run shelters and UNHCR accommodation.\\n“The situation in Syria is not for living.\"\\nPriority has been given to vulnerable cases like Falak, who fled her home in Idlib, Syria, last August with her sons Morad, 5, and Samir, 14. She wanted to leave the war-torn region earlier, but had been waiting for news of her missing husband. Then a rocket fell on her house, killing one of her three sons and maiming her youngest, Morad.\\nThe little boy was rushed to hospital, where Syrian doctors only just managed to save his left leg in a series of complex operations. He needed further medical attention but, after the attack, Falak was in a hurry to leave the country.\\n“The situation in Syria is not for living,” she said of the conflict, which is approaching its sixth tragic anniversary in March. “Every day I looked at my sons’ faces and they were frightened, scared of the bombs. Even now, every time we hear sounds like an aeroplane or like bombs they get very scared. It was difficult, but I knew I had to get out of Syria or die in the attempt. I’d do anything for my sons, to find better life for them.”\\nJust 10\\xa0days after Morad’s operation, Falak and her two sons crossed the Turkish-Syrian border on foot. She paid a stranger to carry Morad, who couldn’t walk, along the mountain path, while border guards shot into the air around them.\\nBut by the time they reached the western coast of Turkey, the little boy’s health had taken a turn for the worse. Without access to post-operative drugs, his left leg had become dangerously inflamed.\\n“I thought, when I get to Turkey I will find better treatment for him. But then he started to get inflammation in his leg,” said Falak. “I decided I had to hurry up and leave.”\\nDesperate to find medical attention for her son, Falak paid smugglers to take her family on a flimsy boat into Greek waters. They were picked up after a frantic hour at sea by the Greek Coastguard, who took one look at Morad and sent him straight to hospital on Lesvos island.\\n\"I knew I had to get out of Syria or die in the attempt.\"\\nFalak and her sons spent the next three weeks in a municipal-run accommodation facility at Kara Tepe, before UNHCR found them space in a nearby apartment, run by local partner Iliaktida. There, Morad began a remarkable recovery. Four months and another operation later, he’s now running around like any other boy his age.\\nBut doctors have said he will need further treatment on the mainland and referred Morad to a specialised bone unit in Athens, a four-hour car journey from the family’s new accommodation in Larissa. Falak knows her son will be better off on the mainland, but after all she has been through, she finds it difficult not to worry.\\n“Of course, we’re much happier here now that we are safe. But anyone would be afraid if you don’t know what is ahead of you. I have two children and one of them is ill, it’s normal to worry. Alone, it’s very difficult to decide what to do.”\\n“When I lost my son I was so afraid for the others. It’s not for me I travel – I travel for my sons, to give them life.”Hanna suffers from pain in her legs and walks with a stick, and Oleksiy, who can barely walk, has poor hearing and eyesight. They stick together and constantly refuse their daughter’s entreaties to leave.\\n“I told her, only one of us will go with you, and only after the second one dies,” Hanna said.\\nThe town of Shchastya, which means “happiness” in Ukrainian, lies right on the front line of Ukraine’s conflict, which has cost nearly 10,000 lives in the 33 months since it started.\\nThe sound of shelling is heard in the town almost every night. Many houses have walls pierced by shells and boarded-up windows.\\n\"It is a place of elderly people with more than half of its population over 60.\"\\nThere have been several battles in and around the town, located in the suburbs of the regional capital Luhansk, and most of the young families have left.\\nNow it is a place of elderly people with more than half of its population over 60, said Natalia Boyko, a project assistant of the NGO HelpAge international, which helps senior citizens worldwide.\\nIn December, HelpAge delivered cash assistance of about $144 per person provided by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency to the most vulnerable elderly residents living near the front line in Ukraine.\\nHanna was one of the recipients. She said that, after receiving the money she immediately spent about $28 of it on medication for her husband. “We spend one of our two pensions entirely on medicines,” she said. A single pension is worth about $56.\\nThe Huzovskys are dependent on their neighbours and humanitarian workers, who buy food for them. Hanna, 80, stopped going out after she nearly fainted outdoors when she went to a pharmacy in December.\\nFor 86-year-old Oleksiy, it is difficult even to walk from one room to another. He spends his days lying in bed, cuddling their two cats Sonya and Masha, or drinking coffee and smoking in the small kitchen. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHanna often watches television for news about the conflict. It brings back memories of World War Two, which she witnessed as a child. Hanna remembers her father lifting her up for the last time before he was conscripted. He went missing in action in 1942.\\n\\xa0“God forbid that one should live through two wars in one lifetime,” said Oleksiy, who experienced World War Two in his native Volyn region in western Ukraine. After the war, he studied geology in the town of Drohobych, where he met Hanna, who was training to become a seamstress. They married in a student dormitory. \\xa0\\nThe family moved to the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine in 1965 and settled in Shchastya. Hanna taught design and technology, while Oleksiy worked as a member of a geological prospecting group searching for oil deposits.\\n“We never hold a grudge against each other for long, because who would take care of us if we don’t take care of each other?”\\nWorking in cold weather and sleeping in unheated caravans led to the first health problems for him. His condition deteriorated after the conflict in Ukraine started in 2014. He stopped going out, even on to the balcony, and became bedridden. “I can’t even see a spoon in my hand now,” he said.\\nOleksiy has several hearing aids, but the only doctor in the region who can adjust them for his needs lives in Severodonetsk 70 km away, and he is unable to use them.\\nOleksiy rarely talks to anyone except his wife. Virtually unable to see or hear, he combats depression by writing poems. He recites a verse that he has composed as his epitaph: “My life is coming to the end and my journey of life is finishing. It was so hard to come here but I did it.”\\nHanna sometimes talks with the cats and sings with her husband. Every evening she speaks by phone to her daughter, who lives in Kyiv and rarely comes to Shchastya. She still grieves for her son, who died young long ago.\\nOnce, after he got up, Hanna was not in the flat. In a panic, he asked neighbours if they knew where she was. They told him she had gone out to a shop. He waited by the entrance until she returned.\\nHanna and Oleksiy have lived together for 56 years and say their marriage has been happy. “There were big sorrows in our life. But we rarely argued over all these years,” Hanna said.\\n“We never hold a grudge against each other for long,” Oleksiy said. “Because who would take care of us if we don’t take care of each other?”Anna Tadyka, 68, showed us around the small kitchen where she spent the whole of last winter.\\xa0 “When it got freezing cold here, I sealed all the doors, put a mattress on the floor near the stove and burst into tears sitting on it,” she said.\\nAs Ukraine enters the coldest months of January and February, with temperatures often falling below minus 20 degrees Celsius, winterization support for eastern Ukraine is not adequate to help vulnerable residents cope with the conditions caused by the conflict.\\xa0\\n“I saved some money and bought coal,” Anna said. “It lasted me one month. But it was of bad quality. It’s like dust!” As she throws coal into the stove, a layer of black dust covers her face.\\nAnna cannot afford to heat every room in her big house, where she lives alone. Coal for the whole winter season costs about US $400. Her annual pension is less than US$600. Even if she managed to save more money to buy more coal, it would be difficult to have it delivered to a village on the front line. The road to Luhanske is damaged and hazardous, and coal distributors avoid the area.\\xa0\\nBecause of the shortage of fuel and money to pay for it, residents started gathering firewood on the outskirts of the village last summer.\\n“Because of fighting and the state of the roads, they do not have the basics to survive through this winter.”\\nNadezhda Rudenok, 66, said they felled trees and spent the summer hauling them to the village. She bought one carload of firewood. “I had thought it wouldn’t last, but then we received some coal as humanitarian aid,” she said.\\nGathering firewood is highly dangerous, since it often conceals unexploded ordnance which can explode if disturbed.\\nResident Nina Zus took home some firewood from the field. She put it into the stove and when she cooked dinner, there was an explosion that injured her arm. Since then, she has not used firewood for fuel.\\nIn early January, Nina received coal from the NGO Proliska, a local partner of the UN refugee agency UNHCR. Two hundred Luhanske residents will receive support under the scheme.\\nPablo Mateu, UNHCR representative in Ukraine, said they were trying to reach people who had no money.\\n“Because of fighting and the state of the roads, they do not have the basics to survive through this winter,” he said. “There were many communities with people spending nights in the basement or living out in the cold.”\\n“In essence, ours is a street of old people. After the shelling, the young people left the village.”\\nIt was difficult for humanitarian agencies to reach them because of the dynamics of the conflict, he added.\\nSince the heavy fighting in Luhanske in December, people are fearful of being caught up in the shelling when they are out of doors. When UNHCR’s coal truck reached the village, residents, who range in age from 50 to 80, helped each other to unload the coal sacks quickly.\\nHalyna Samokhvalova, 79, said she found living alone a challenge. Her daughter died 13 years ago and she has no any relatives with whom she could move in away from the conflict zone. She relies on her neighbour Victor, 64.\\n“In essence, ours is a street of old people,” said Victor. “After the shelling, the young people left the village.” He is one of the youngest people on the street and helps his more elderly neighbours get through the day.\\n“Every morning I ask Halyna if she needs anything, how she feels today. I can bring her some food, like sausage or bread.”\\nVictor said he twice helped her replace windows broken by the shelling. The windows of his own house were also damaged several times, but he decided to board them up.\\n“I will wait to repair them when the war ends,” he said.\"I have suffered a great deal; these past few days have been really bad,\" she says after a long silence. \"I didn\\'t have enough food. I had raw cassava. This is what I fed my children. When they were tired, we rested then I gave them some water.\"\\nSidah, 30, recently arrived in Kuluba, a small dusty town in northern Uganda close to one of the many points along the border with South Sudan.\\nShe is one of thousands of refugees streaming into Uganda since intense fighting broke out again in July last year following the collapse of a peace deal between the government and opposition forces.\\nSouth Sudanese refugees hit 1.5 million mark\\n\\nNone\\nWith an extremely volatile security situation forcing more refugees to flee, the latest influx is straining the capacity of transit and reception centres, which are too small for the growing number of arrivals.\\n\"I walked for two days to the border, but I didn\\'t use the main roads.\"\\nSince January 2017, more than 52,000 refugees have been received in Uganda, with the majority crossing at border entry points such as Busia, the one Sidah and her family used, to find refuge. Many refugees are using informal entry points citing the presence of armed groups on the routes to the main border points.\\nThousands more have made huge detours on foot to escape South Sudan, heading south through the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC, then east into Uganda for fear of attacks from armed forces present along the direct routes. Some report walking for more than a month before finally reaching safety.\\nThe majority of the refugees are being hosted by Uganda, where a total of some 698,000 have now arrived.\\xa0In less than six months, Uganda has more than tripled its population of South Sudanese refugees, hosting the largest share of the people who have fled their homes in the neighbouring country.\\nEthiopia is also hosting some 342,000, while more than 305,000 otthers are in Sudan and some 89,000 in Kenya, 68,000 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 4,900 in the Central African Republic.\\nNone\\nSidah endured a three-day journey to the border from her home in Mogo in Yei County in southwestern South Sudan, which enjoyed relative stability until fighting spread to the area.\\n\"I walked for two days to the border but I didn\\'t use the main roads,\" she says. \"We walked through the bush because if you meet soldiers they might kill you.\"\\n\"I spent six days hiding in the bush with my six children.\"\\nSarah Apayi is one of 6,000 refugees who used the DRC route to get into Uganda since the middle of 2016. Due to checkpoints and banditry along the main roads, more refugees are forced to use this longer route, walking several days to reach Uganda, usually with few belongings and limited access to food, water and other needs.\\n\"My husband was kidnapped over a year ago after the war started,\" Sarah says. \"I spent six days hiding in the bush with my six children trying to get to DRC.” She spent another two days from Bokolo in DRC to Uganda. “It was difficult because it is not safe in the bush. I was worried about wild animals but it was better to try that way than to be attacked by the rebels.”\\nLike Sidah and Sarah, women and children continue to bear the brunt of the conflict, making up 86 per cent of refugees arriving in Uganda.\\n\"This has been a massive, unrelenting emergency with close to 2,000 refugees arriving in Uganda daily,\" says Nasir Fernandes, a senior emergency operations coordinator with UNHCR. \"Our number one priority is saving lives and ensuring the basic needs of new arrivals are met as quickly as possible.\"\\nSidah Hawa queues with her children at Kuluba transit centre to get registered and have her children vaccinated.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Michele Sibiloni\\nTo cope with the growing influx, new arrivals are first taken to a temporary reception centre in Kuluba, where refugees are registered by the government as soon as they arrive. They are provided with sleeping mats, blankets and sanitary materials, and children are immunised against measles and polio, while they await to be transferred to Palorinya settlement.\\nPalorinya settlement opened in December 2016 after Bidibidi settlement became full. Having been opened in August 2016, Bidibidi settlement has become one of the largest refugee-hosting areas in the world in the space of a few months. Preparations are underway to open a new settlement as Palorinya is already close to its hosting capacity.\\nUganda is widely recognized as having progressive and forward-thinking refugee and asylum policies. Upon receiving refugee status, refugees are provided with small areas of land in villages integrated within the local host community; a pioneering approach that enhances social cohesion and allows both refugees and host communities to live together peacefully.\\nThe process of receiving refugees at the border to place them in settlements takes an average of just three days. In addition, refugees are granted a range of rights and freedoms, allowing them to work, start businesses and freely move around the country.\\n\"I am happy that I am finally safe.\"\\nIn less than six months, Uganda has more than tripled its population of South Sudanese refugees, hosting more than half of the 1.1 million people who have fled their homes in the neighbouring country.\\n\"The Ugandan Government deserves tremendous praise in their efforts in handling the emergency,\" Fernandes says. \"But this crisis is not something Uganda can tackle alone. It’s now absolutely vital that the international community pay attention to what is happening and supports Uganda in providing these refugees with an environment in which they can live in safety and dignity.\"\\nIn 2016, the humanitarian appeal for the South Sudan response received less than 75 per cent of the funds needed to meet the demands. Without further contributions, the abilities of the humanitarian response to provide critical aid and key basic services could become severely compromised.\\nSidah says she is grateful to have found peace in Uganda and a chance to start over.\\n\"I am happy that I am finally safe,\" she says. \"I wanted the suffering to end and I now feel that it is in the process of ending.\"\\nDonate now“It was no life there in Syria, we were all so scared all of the time. I just wanted peace, nothing else,” says Syrian refugee Halima Taha, 30, who fled the war at home four years ago with her husband and three children. Arriving in Germany, they volunteered to move to Golzow, a tiny village on the German-Polish border.\\nAt the time, Halima had no idea what her family’s arrival meant to the villagers. Back then, the village’s shrinking population was bad news for Golzow’s primary school, known by film fans the world over as the setting for \\'The Children of Golzow\\', an epic 42-hour documentary filmed over five decades.\\nYet the school’s fame wasn’t enough to save it from the effects of a creeping decline. Over the space of eight years, Golzow’s population shrank by 12 per cent, to just 835 people. Then, in March 2015, the unthinkable happened. For the first time since it opened in 1961, the school failed to make up the pupil numbers required for a reception class.\\n“It was no life there in Syria, we were all so scared all of the time.\"\\n“A lot of people have moved away in recent years,” explains school headmistress Gabi Thomas. “There just weren’t the young parents having children who would go to the school. Activity and life is very important in a rural region, and that is brought in by children.”\\nThe community was distraught, fearing the beginning of the end for their beloved school. That is until Golzow’s mayor Frank Schütz came up with an inspired solution. He would ask local authorities to find refugee families with primary school-age children who might want to move into one of Golzow’s many empty apartments. “It was an added advantage that we were helping someone who is actually helping us as well,” says Mayor Schütz.\\nSixty kilometres away, Halima and her young family had just arrived in Brandenburg’s main reception centre at Eisenhüttenstadt, utterly exhausted after a gruelling three and a half years on the road from Syria to Germany. When they were asked if they’d like to move into a donated apartment in a nearby village, they jumped at the chance.\\n“We didn’t mind what kind of place we went to, as long as it was clean, with good people,” says Halima. “We thought, why not?” Months later, Halima, her family and another Syrian family arrived in Golzow, bringing with them six much-needed school-age children in time for the new school year.\\nAlthough they were a little older than their classmates, three young newcomers joined the reception class, pushing numbers over the required minimum of 15. It was win-win – the year group was saved and the Syrians got a new home.\\nNearly two years on, one of the schools’ rescuers, Halima’s 10-year-old daughter Kalama, has adjusted quickly into her new life. “Lots of things are different here, of course,” she says, surrounded by a group of German school friends in a break between lessons.\\nThough Kamala and her family are Muslims, Kalama said she’s enjoyed learning about German customs. “In Syria, we never celebrated Christmas or Easter or Halloween,” she adds, in near-fluent German. “I like Easter best because we get to hunt for chocolate eggs.”\\nKamala is a bright pupil and has now been promoted from her introductory reception class up into the third grade, where her favourite subjects are maths, music and sport. Outside of school, she finds plenty to keep her occupied, playing badminton with friends in the village after-school club, or learning to ride her next-door neighbour’s ponies.\\n“I like Easter best because we get to hunt for chocolate eggs.”\\n“They want to know about us and we want to know about them,” says Kamala of her German classmates. “There’s so much to tell and explain. Sometimes I translate for the others into Arabic or German.”\\nLike their daughter, Kalama’s parents Halima and Fadi are so settled that they often act as go-betweens between newcomers and locals. Last February, they helped welcome a third Syrian family to Golzow.\\n“We helped them a lot, when they didn’t know where stuff was or how things worked,” says Halima, who believed it was the least they could do given the welcome they had received from villagers.\\n“Everyone came to welcome us here with flowers,” recalls Halima. “I was so surprised, I couldn’t do anything but cry. If more families come, they’d be very welcome. Golzow is very open, it’s a very small village and the people are very beautiful.”\\nHalima and her family now have refugee status and a visa allowing them to live and work in Germany for the next three years. Halima works part time as an Arabic interpreter for a German charity that helps asylum-seekers. Meanwhile, Fadi is looking for work and is practising for his German driving test. He also enjoys fishing and tending his allotment garden with his neighbours.\\nEven so, for all their hard work fitting into village life, Fadi and Halima still miss their old lives. “It can be difficult,” says Fadi, 40, who ran a real estate business at home in Latakia. “We had a good life in Syria. But then the war came and we had to leave. Now we are trying to have a good life again. We all help each other here. Golzow is a second family for us. But of course, all we want is the bloodshed in Syria to stop so we can go home again.”\\n“I’d like that my children and I can return to Syria one day,” agrees Halima. “Home is home, after all. While we wait, the children must learn, study and get good careers. At least here we are safe.\"Welcome to Timisoara’s coolest multicultural party.\\n“Try this rice with raisins,” says Fareshta from Afghanistan. “My mother made it.” We chat. I want to meet her for coffee next day, but she will be tied up, taking an important exam as part of her university computer course.\\nThe room is full of refugees, trying to make a success of their new lives in Romania, and residents like party host Flavius Ilioni-Loga of the ecumenical organization AIDRom that supports them with counselling, classes, accommodation and multicultural events.\\nNone\\nWhen we meet in a café, he wants to avoid the feeling he is being interrogated, so we agree to play a game instead of conducting a regular interview.

But we couldn’t do that.”\\n“My father wanted a better life for us,” he said. For some years, they did have a good life. Zaher, now 26, graduated as a civil engineer in Abu Dhabi.\\nThe family was in Romania, visiting a brother of Zaher’s who was studying medicine, when his father’s employers in the UAE terminated his contract. “That was it,” Zaher says. “We were supposed to leave the Emirates and go back to Iraq. But we couldn’t do that, so we stayed in Romania.”\\nNone\\nBack at the AIDRom house, refugees with small children are enjoying a creative afternoon with Simona Ilioni-Loga, a psychologist and art therapist. Using toilet rolls and coloured paper, they are making animals such as rabbits, penguins and hedgehogs.\\nFareshta’s mother, Fahima, who made the rice and raisins for the party, is there with her younger daughter, Farnat, 9, who is sticking a cotton wool tail on to a pink rabbit.\\n“We like coming here, it’s relaxing,” Fahima says. “Our family has had a stressful time.”\\nFahima, who was a biochemist, and her husband Abdul, an engineer and journalist, decided to leave Afghanistan two years ago when their home city of Herat became too violent, and join relatives already in Romania. “My brother and sister were killed in a bomb there,” she says.\\n“We want to make a new life, a peaceful life, a normal life, to laugh and smile.”\\nLife in Romania has not been easy. Abdul has been reduced to washing cars. Their elder son is working in a fast food restaurant. The two youngest children are at school. Fareshta, 19, while working part-time in a shoe shop, is studying at Timisoara’s Universitatea de Vest (West University).\\nThe first-year final exam is over and she has passed. Smiling, she comes out of the library with her friend Laila, 25, also from Afghanistan. The two young women are in the same class, studying informatics and software engineering. Laila, who is married and has a six-year-old son, has passed, too.\\n“We chose IT because there are good job prospects,” says Laila. “But more than that, we wanted to do something fresh and modern, not connected with the past.”\\nThe past is far from inspiring. Fareshta remembers “men with beards” (the Taliban) pushing her mother around. Laila, who is from the Hazara minority, has seen worse. “The Taliban used to stop the school bus, pick out the Hazaras among the students and shoot them,” she says.\\nThe women could hardly have hoped for careers in Afghanistan. “It’s hard to get jobs there because women have to be accompanied to work by men,” says Fareshta. “And there’s nepotism and corruption in the labour market.”\\n“We were tired of all this,” says Laila. “We want to make a new life, a peaceful life, a normal life, to laugh and smile.” The men in their families support their aspirations.\\n“My husband is happy for me,” says Laila. “He wanted to study too but he says, ‘no, if I can’t, you try, maybe my turn will come in future’. He is a good man.”\\nFareshta and Laila have hard work ahead of them to complete their degrees. They are aiming for jobs in big companies, or possibly to start a business of their own.\\nThey could be just the kind of computer specialists Zaher will need to develop his storytelling website. For the refugees, it’s not just about partying but socialising and networking for a successful future in Romania.Since neighbouring European Union (EU) countries closed their borders in the spring of 2016 and started collective expulsions back into non-EU Serbia, the number\\xa0of refugees and migrants stuck in the country has\\xa0swelled from a few hundred to close to 8,000.\\nIn response, Serbian authorities and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, together with humanitarian partners, have increased capacity at heated government shelters for refugees and migrants in Serbia from below 2,000 to close to 7,000 beds.\\nThanks to these efforts, some 85 percent of refugees in the country, including all women and families, are accommodated in 17 government facilities. Meanwhile, a few hundred men and boys still squat in squalid and unsafe conditions.\\nThe coldest winter for years has amplified the urgency of efforts to persuade all remaining children like Aziz to move out of derelict buildings into government shelters.\\nIn recent days, over 400 refugees and migrants, including 200 children, agreed to leave the unsanitary, improvised shelter in Belgrade and move into nearby accommodation opened by the government in mid-January. Those who agreed to move say they are pleased to have done so.\\n“I had to leave, it was so cold and so dirty there,” said Kiramat Safi, a 17-year-old unaccompanied child from Afghanistan, who after four months outside volunteered to leave the warehouses and move into another government-run shelter at Krnjaca a fortnight ago.\\n“Now I’m feeling much better because it’s warmer here,” he added. “There’s no smoke and I can sleep inside.”\\nBut until now, Aziz refused to move into a shelter. He was waiting for news of his father, who went missing for nearly three weeks following a botched attempt to cross the border. The eldest child of eight, Aziz left his family and home in Nanghahar province, Afghanistan, eight months ago, travelling together with his father, Habib Rahman, and uncle, Khan.\\nAziz said they had been heading to join a second uncle, an asylum-seeker in France, but moved into the warehouses in late October after failing to cross the border into Croatia.\\nAgain and again they tried to cross, but were repeatedly expelled back into Serbia.\\nThen, during their last attempt three weeks ago, disaster struck. The group were crossing a river in sub-zero temperatures when their raft sunk, leaving them soaking wet and unbearably cold. They called out for help from nearby Serbian border guards who took Aziz’s father into custody.\\nLetting the others go, police told Aziz and his uncle Khan to go and register at a nearby government shelter. But with no way to contact Habib Rahman and not knowing his whereabouts, they instead decided to returned to Belgrade to wait for him. Then, two days ago, Aziz’s father walked back into the derelict building.\\nUNHCR has, through its partners, since approached Habib Rahman and Aziz and urged them to move out of the unsanitary makeshift camp and into a government shelter.\\n\\xa0“I was so happy when I found my son here,” said Habib Rahman, 31. “Now, we don’t know what to do. I want to go the shelter, but at the same time we want to try again to cross the border. We’ll probably go to the shelter but I don’t want to stay there very long.”\\nUNHCR continues to distribute leaflets and counsel those in the warehouse on their right to be accommodated in government shelters. It has worked hard to identify unaccompanied children sleeping rough in Belgrade and at other locations.\\nHowever, several hundred refugees and migrants, including a number of children like Aziz, remain unconvinced and are still camping out in the warehouses and surrounding buildings in downtown Belgrade.\\nNone\\nFearing setbacks, refugees in Serbia sometimes choose cold warehouses to government-run centres. \\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR\\nNoneAll of a sudden, it\\'s over.

Rehema’s husband died years before, leaving her to care for the family, and to arrange their hurried journey to Congo when Burundi became too unsafe for them.\\n\"We don\\'t know why they were killed. Nobody gave us a motive. At that time, some people kidnapped and killed others, just like that,\" she says.\\nOutside of the drama group life is difficult for Rehema. She works hard every day to put food on the family\\'s table, selling vegetables for meagre earnings at a rudimentary table outside her home. Tomatoes are arranged in pyramids of four, next to green peppers, and a tin can with some palm oil that is sold by the spoonful.\\nRehema is particularly vulnerable. She is a widow in charge of a family, and also suffers from chronic illnesses. UNHCR recently supplied her with medicine for her diabetes and other conditions, and the agency\\'s staff look in on her and the children from time to time. It makes her feel safer, she says: \"I feel also like I am not abandoned\".\\n“She is in need of protection,” says Esther Kashira, a UNHCR protection associate in Uvira. “We follow up on her case, as we undertake field visits. Our presence helps to protect the refugees and reassures them.”\\nIn the dusty courtyard, rehearsals for the next scene begin. Rehema plays the mother of a boy who dropped out of school and fell into bad company. She delivers her lines with deep and genuine emotion.\\nHer performance is so compelling because she is drawing on personal experience: her youngest son, Swedi, 16, has not been in class since they fled Burundi. Her daughter Shebaby, 18, dreams of going to university. But, so far, there is not enough money to pay for the fees.\\nDespite the challenges, Rehema will never give up. \"I have illnesses that cannot be cured,\" she says, matter of fact. \"If the kids study, they can fend for themselves in life. \"\\nAnd with that, she turns back to her rehearsals, drawing from the theatre and the crowds the energy she needs to keep going, for herself, and for her children.Breakfast is not included in the room price but I sign up eagerly, knowing that at the Magdas, staffed by former refugees from around the world, the breakfast buffet is a cornucopia of dishes from Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\\n“Stay open-minded; find something unique,” is the hotel’s slogan. A stay at the Magdas is unusual, educational and value for money, giving visitors who seek something different from Austrian tradition an experience of modern, multicultural Vienna.\\nThe hotel, within sight of Vienna’s landmark giant Ferris wheel, was a care home before it was converted, as it advertises, “to welcome globetrotters, revellers, explorers and discoverers.\" Opened in 2015, it employs 10 hotel professionals and 20 former refugees from 16 countries.\\n“I was here at the very start… I helped to empty out the rooms and fix things up. It was a lot of fun.\"\\nIt is a daughter company of the Catholic charity Caritas, which ran the care home. It must be self-financing, without losing sight of its goal of helping the disadvantaged.\\nNone\\nDinis Angsberg is one of the former refugees working at the hotel in Vienna\\nOur opening was very timely, as it coincided with the refugee crisis,” says joint chief executive Gabriela Sonnleitner. “Motivated people wanting to work arrived when the labour market was looking for workers. The two don’t often come together, especially in hospitality, where you need quality staff.”\\nThe hotel employs former refugees who have been granted asylum in Austria. They are expected to speak at least basic German. “It’s okay if they have skills deficits but we encourage them to improve,” says Sonnleitner.\\nAt the front desk, I experience the courtesy and competence of Omid Sharif, 25, from Afghanistan, who started working at the Magdas on night shifts. He performed so well that he was promoted to deputy head of reception. Taking my key, I retire to my room, decorated in blue with a red velvet armchair and a knitted lampshade.\\nNo two rooms are exactly alike. Designers, working to a limited budget, \\'up-cycled\\' furniture and fittings from the old retirement home to create an arty atmosphere. Cupboards were cut up into benches and old doors re-hung with mirrors. In a witty touch, luggage racks from Austrian trains were put up to take guests’ suitcases. Downstairs, a comfortable café/library was created for relaxation or social events.\\nWhen I wake, the vacuum cleaner is whining in the corridor outside. Toita Monsarowa, a senior member of the cleaning staff who fled from war-torn Chechnya in 2004, has been at the Magdas from the outset.\\n“I was here at the very start, when it was being converted from the nursing home,” she says. “I helped to empty out the rooms and fix things up. It was a lot of fun. The luggage racks from the trains were black with grime but I polished them up.”\\nMonsarowa, who was a pastry chef in Grozny, has a new life now. “I work here five days a week,” she says. “I have a flat. One son is working and the other is going to school. Life is working out for me.\"\\nIn the breakfast room, Sherahmad Razi, 32, from Faryab province in Afghanistan, shows me to a sunny table by the window. He has been in Austria for eight years after travelling via Iran, Turkey and the Balkans. Back in Afghanistan he was a welder.\\nHe says working in a hotel is big change, but he can turn his hand to anything. Before he was granted asylum, he used to sleep late and now he starts work at 6 am. “I like interacting with the customers and it’s good to be earning a living,” he says.\\nIn his spare time, he plays football and billiards and walks by the River Danube but sometimes, he says, worry about home makes it difficult to appreciate the life he now has.\\n“In Afghanistan, my mother is sick and my parents live in an area [on the border with Turkmenistan] where war is in front of our door. When there is no problem, there is no problem for me, but when they are ill or something, I worry.”\\nHe married his wife Lina just before he left Afghanistan and has not seen her for eight years. He hopes to bring her to join him in Austria.\\n“I’ve learnt German and I still go to classes. Maybe one day I will have the chance to be a chef or manager.\"\\nAt the buffet, I help myself to muesli with exotic fruits, scrambled egg in little pots, couscous salad, Arab bread and hummus, all washed down with a strong Viennese coffee with milk.\\nSegun Prince, 45, from Benin, has made the couscous. One of three Africans working in the kitchen, he is doing well in his new hotel career.\\n“Back in Benin, I was a tailor,” he says. “It was nice work but I like the kitchen as well. I meet guests from all over the world and ask them, ‘How do you feel? Did you enjoy your food?’”\\nPrince left Benin in 2002 and came to Europe via Libya, making the dangerous trip across the over Mediterranean. “There was no hope in Africa,” he says.\\n“When they started to make the hotel here, they called us [refugees] to help and I carried beds and wardrobes – it was very exciting. I’ve learnt German and I still go to classes. Maybe one day I will have the chance to be a chef or manager.”\\nAt reception, Sharif, who speaks English and German as well as three Afghan languages, is juggling several tasks. He came to Vienna aged 14, before the refugee crisis.\\n“My father was an Afghan government official in exile and he was already here,” he says, before breaking off to answer the telephone.\\n“I dreamt of being a pilot, or getting an apprenticeship in IT, but I started work here instead, doing nights. It was rather boring and hard on the body.” He breaks off again to give directions to a visitor.\\nI hand in my key and he gives me my bill.\\n“Thanks for staying with us, ma’am. See you next time you come to Vienna.”At 11 p.m., they came to a halt about half a kilometer from a barren, sandy beach. “Get out and run to the shore!” the smugglers shouted. They filed out and noticed other buses, and hundreds of people ahead of and behind them. Bassem kicked off his flip-flops, took Doaa’s hand, and they sprinted toward the water.\\nOne of two wooden dinghies, about three-and-a-half-meters long, was moving toward them, but to reach it, they had to struggle through breaking waves until the water was up to Bassem’s shoulders. They reached the dinghy, and Bassem pulled himself over the side while a smuggler lifted Doaa in.\\nHundreds of people were already on the boat when Doaa and Bassem climbed on deck. They soon learned that a good number of these weary looking travelers had already been drifting at sea for days, impatiently waiting for Doaa and Bassem’s group to join them so the smugglers could fill every square inch of the trawler.\\nDoaa as a refugee in Egypt before she embarked on the deadly boat journey.\\xa0 ©\\xa0Archive Doaa Al Zamel\\nIt was late afternoon on their third day when a double-decker boat approached. One of the smugglers explained that the waves were too high for so many people so they had to split up the group. About 150 others disembarked with Doaa and Bassem. They had been told the trip would take two days at most, and nearly four days had already passed. “How much longer?” someone asked the new captain. “Just 19 hours, and we will reach Italy,” the captain reassured them. The passengers cheered and clapped in response, calling out “Hamdullah, God willing, we will make it to Italy!”\\nBut just hours later, Doaa was napping when the sounds of an engine and men shouting insults in an Egyptian dialect startled her awake. A blue fishing boat approached them at full speed. Doaa could see about 10 men on board, dressed in ordinary clothes, not the all-black outfits of the smugglers.\\n“You dogs!” they shouted. “Sons of bitches! Stop the boat! Where do you think you are going? You should’ve stayed to die in your own country.”\\nThen, all of a sudden, they began hurling planks of wood at the passengers on the refugee boat, their eyes wild with hatred. Doaa stared in horror as the boat sped toward them.\\nBassem, Doaa\\'s fiancé, drowned after treading water next to her for two days.\\xa0 ©\\xa0Archive Doaa Al Zamel\\nThere was a scramble for life jackets, as desperate prayers were interrupted by terrified shouts and children crying. The boat approaching them accelerated and rammed into the side of the boat just below where Doaa and Bassem were standing, producing a shriek of metal and shattering wood.\\nNone\\nThe attackers sped toward them again, and when they rammed the side of Bassem and Doaa’s boat, the rickety vessel took a sudden, violent nosedive into the sea. Bassem’s hand was yanked away from Doaa’s as he fought to regain his balance, and she lost sight of him in the mass of people tumbling forward.\\nNone\\nDoaa al Zamel, who watched her fiancé and hundreds of passengers die at sea, but rescued a small child, has had her story written in a book, A Hope More Powerful Than The Sea, by UN Spokesperson Melissa Fleming.\\xa0 ©\\xa0Elena Dorfman\\nShe heard screaming all around her, muffled only by the sound of the boat’s motor. People desperately grabbed onto anything that floated\\u200a—\\u200aluggage, water canisters, even other people, pulling them down with them. Doaa noticed that the sea around her was red and soon realized that people were being sucked into the boat’s propeller and dismembered by its blades.\\nOverwhelmed with panic and fear, Doaa began shouting for Bassem. A few long seconds later, she heard his voice.\\nShe turned her head toward the sound and spotted him in the sea. She wanted to go to him but couldn’t bring herself to jump into the water. The boat was sinking at an angle that was drawing her toward the spinning propeller. “Let go, or it will cut you up too!” Bassem cried out.\\n“Put this over your head so you can float.”\\nShe closed her eyes and opened her hands, falling backward, arms and legs spread as she hit the water. She was buoyant for a few seconds on her back, then she felt someone pulling at her headscarf, which slipped off her head.\\nAs she lay floating on her back, she felt her long hair being yanked under the water. Those who were drowning below were grabbing at whatever they could to try to pull themselves to the surface. They pulled Doaa’s face below the water, but somehow she managed to push their hands away.\\nThen she spotted Bassem swimming toward her holding a blue floating ring, the kind toddlers use in baby pools. “Put this over your head so you can float,” he said as he passed her the partially inflated ring.\\nThe refugee boat hero who saved a child and stirred a continent | Melissa Fleming | TEDxThessaloniki \\nOf the 150 people who had been onboard, somewhere between 50 and 100 survived the attack and were left floating aimlessly in the sea.\\nWhen the sun rose the next day, it was clear to Doaa that the night had taken at least half of the initial survivors. A small group of those remaining gathered around Bassem and Doaa, treading water.\\nNoneBack in the pool, her sights are fixed on the 2020 Games in Tokyo. She is also studying hard, working to catch up on an education disrupted by war. However, she still finds time to champion the refugee cause.\\n“I have 10\\xa0swimming training sessions a week and this is kind of my life right now,” Yusra, 18, told UNHCR in Berlin. “But there are also a lot of things in my head rolling around about refugees and helping people. I want to change people’s perceptions of what a refugee is.”\\nTeam Refugees look to the future: Yusra Mardini\\nYusra said her own experience of flight meant she was determined to keep the refugee issue high on the world’s list of priorities. She is keen to develop skills as a motivational speaker, building on appearances such as her address to the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants in New York in September.\\nThis month she spoke at a high-profile side event at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where she was introduced by former American Olympic athlete Michael Johnson as “one of the bravest women.”\\n\"I want to change people’s perceptions.”\\nAbove all, she wants to use her voice to show the world that refugees are normal people in extraordinary circumstances, forced to flee death and destruction at home. She is keen to tackle misconceptions such as views that refugees are uneducated or are relocating for financial gain.\\n“People think that refugees have nothing, that they know nothing or that they came just to take something,” she said. “But a lot of refugees are doctors, a lot of them are engineers.\\n“We had to flee our homes. We came here because we wanted peace, because we couldn’t take much more of war.”\\nNone\\nYusra risked her life last year when she fled to Europe to escape the Syrian conflict. “For us it was either you’re going to go and maybe die along the way, or you’re going to stay here and die every day.”\\nYusra said her own story was an example of the realities of life for many refugees in Western Europe. Many may know her as the girl who jumped into the Aegean from a sinking boat with her 21-year-old sister Sarah and helped push it and its 20 desperate passengers to safety.\\nBeing a refugee is more than perilous sea crossings and narrow escapes. For many of Europe’s newcomers, life has settled into the wait for a decision on an application for asylum, a frustrating battle to reunite their families or a struggle to get an education or find work.\\nYusra is no exception. At school in Berlin she is wrestling with daily German lessons in an effort to finish her disrupted high school education in a foreign tongue. Like many other refugees her age, she left before finishing high school and cannot attend university until she completes secondary school in her host country.\\nLanguage was an even bigger barrier for her parents, who also live in Berlin, she said. Both had worked hard in Syria were unaccustomed to enforced idleness.\\nShe praised Germany’s decision to open its doors to refugees, but added that it did not know what to do with them once they were there.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“I’m proud to stand for peace, for decency and dignity for all those fleeing violence.”\\nHowever, waiting around with little to do was nothing compared with the difficulties faced by most refugees throughout the word. She fears for friends and her extended family left behind in Syria.\\n“I want to tell the world about what’s happening in Syria, about the people stuck there,” she said. “I see a lot of bad videos and think: ‘Why am I here safe while Syrian people are being killed in Aleppo and elsewhere?’ It could just as well have been me or my mum or my sister being killed.”\\nWith humanitarian crises unfolding all over the world, Yusra knows there’s a huge amount of work to be done to improve the lot of those forced to flee. She said she believed the world was ready to hear their point of view.\\n“We must grab their attention,” she said. “I want to talk about it. You tell me what you have against refugees and I can explain to you, I can show you even, how and why you’re wrong.”From her hospital bed, Najwa sent out a flurry of excited text messages announcing the birth of her daughter to a new, unlikely group friends – members of a Hutterite colony half an hour away in Brandon, Manitoba.\\nNone\\nMeet the Hutterites colony who stepped up to sponsor the Al Hamoud family from Syria\\nPaul Waldner, an educator in the colony, was the first to suggest the idea after a visiting Hutterite teacher from Germany told him how the colony could make a difference by helping refugees in need. Paul then approached his father, president of the colony, who told him: “Our ancestors were refugees long ago – people were always there to help them.”\\n“Our ancestors were refugees long ago – people were always there to help them.”\\nAs the process moved forward, Paul and his wife Wanda turned to Enes and Fata Muheljić, a couple living in Wawanesa. They had arrived as refugees from Bosnia in the early 1990s, also privately sponsored by the community. “When we saw the Al Hamoud family’s papers, we saw ourselves and our journey,” says Enes. “We had to help.”\\nBefore the war, Najwa Hussein had taught at an elementary school in Hama, Syria. Her husband, Reyad, worked in construction. Just 10 days after they fled to Lebanon, the family home that Reyad had spent years building was destroyed in a bomb strike.\\nThe young Syrian family of four spent three years in exile – and almost escaped by boat across the Mediterranean – until, finally, they learned that they would be resettled in Canada.\\nOn the night of their arrival, a group from the colony packed themselves into a van and drove the two and a half hours to Winnipeg.\\n“When they came down the escalator [at the airport], I started to jump I was so excited,” says Elaine Hofer, one of the family’s sponsors.\\nNajwa, who wears a hijab and felt nervous about arriving in a new country with unknown customs, was relieved when her sponsors came into view. “When I saw their dress – preserving their heritage and their origins – this made me happy,” she says. She loved that the Hutterites still spoke German as their first language and that minorities in a large country could keep their identity and traditions. “A country doesn\\'t change anyone. If one changes, it’s from the inside.”\\nWhile Paul, Wanda and Elaine were excited, not everyone on the colony was immediately receptive to sponsorship. Even Paul’s daughter, Kayla, was apprehensive – unsure why her father was challenging the stability of daily life.\\n“When they came down the escalator, I started to jump I was so excited.\"\\nBut the cold winter of the family’s arrival gave way to the greenery and long days of summer, and the Al Hamouds were invited out for frequent bonfires and bike rides. Najwa would regularly make use of the colony’s supply of vegetables, cooking together with Elaine and Wanda. The Muheljić family, alongside the Hutterites, patiently taught Reyad and Najwa to speak English. As the children spun around on the grass playing games, Paul, Reyad and Enes watched, sipping endless cups of Turkish coffee.\\nIn Kayla’s graduation speech to members of the colony, months after the family arrived, she spoke of a life-changing experience. “I never, ever, in a million years, would have figured they would snuggle their way into my heart as easily as they did,” she told the audience.\\nLater, the family made the difficult decision to move from Wawanesa to Brandon, the second largest city in the province, where jobs and school were closer. But, despite a half-hour drive from the colony to the city, visits were still frequent.\\nIn the lead up to the birth of Najwa’s daughter, the community fussed over her, making sure everything was perfect. When the text message went out that the baby had been born, the hospital room soon became a swirl of flowing dresses. Najwa’s sponsors, now close friends, rushed into see the newborn.\\nAs they crowded around, the couple revealed that they had named her Janna – Arabic for ‘paradise’.\\n“Though it\\'s an Arabic name, I felt part of name was for us, her Canadian family, and how we fell in love with each other,” says Elaine. “She captured both worlds with that name.”\\nNone“It was very emotional,” says Thuy, 53. “I could empathize with what they were feeling. I could feel their sense of loss. But I could also feel their sense excitement for a new beginning.”\\nForty-one years ago, Thuy was also resettled\\xa0in Canada as a refugee\\xa0at the tender age of 12, after fleeing war-torn Vietnam in 1975 with\\xa0seven of her brothers and sisters.\\xa0\\nLeaving behind their parents, the group had boarded a ship to South Korea, beginning a\\xa0 journey at sea that would last 18 days. Once they reached land, they lived in a South Korean refugee camp for two months. “You\\xa0know vaguely that your life is falling apart,” says Thuy. “But you have the optimism of a young person – aware of all the wonderful things that you are going to do – and that is what we focused on.”\\nThuy (right) and her partner have committed to becoming a safety net for the Nouman family.\\nAmong the nervous family members at the airport, Thuy spotted Narjes Nouman, the eldest of seven children. “When I looked at Narjes I could see how I was when I first came at the age of 13 – and all the different experiences that she will go through.”\\nThe Nouman family is among the 13,000 refugees resettled in Canada over the past year, through the country’s private sponsorship program. Originally developed to assist Vietnamese refugees like Thuy Nguyen in the late 1970s, the system allows residents to pool their money and resources together to provide financial and social support for one year.\\nTwo years after their own arrival in Canada, Thuy and her siblings were able to sponsor their parents, reuniting the family.\\n\"I could feel their sense of loss. But I could also feel their sense excitement for a new beginning.”\\n“[My parents] instilled in us a sense of social responsibility,” says Thuy. “That, one day, we can also give back to others who were in our position.”\\nThat day finally came in 2016, when she and husband Michael pored over a list of Syrian refugee families approved for sponsorship. When she saw a family of nine, she jumped at the opportunity.\\n“I told Michael, ‘I’m from a big family. I can handle this,’” says Thuy, herself one of 15 children.\\nFor the Nouman family, the news they would be moving to Canada could not have come soon enough.\\nAt one point in the war, as bombs pummeled the family’s hometown of Homs, Syria, they became trapped inside their house and huddled together in the bathroom for more than a week. During rare moments of stillness, they would sneak outside in search of food. Suddenly, the bucolic summer vacations spent at the sea and in the countryside with relatives were no more. “I didn’t want my kids to see death,” says the father, Mohamed, explaining their decision to flee.\\nThe family fled from Syria to Lebanon and then to Jordan for safety. But the two years in Amman provided neither work nor stability. All members of the family slept in the same single room of a cramped apartment.\\nNone\\n“On the day that we first heard that we are going to come to Canada, dad came and told us and I said to him, ‘Wow!’” remembers Narjes. “I started singing and dancing because we were going to Canada! It was such a wonderful feeling.”\\nOn their first night in Toronto, worried they would freeze from the cold, the family all slept in their new winter clothes, only to find the building’s heating quickly left them sweating.\\nTrained as a welder back in Syria, Mohamed says he wants nothing more than to work again, providing for both his family and the community. “I love my profession and you must benefit the country with things that you know,” he says. However, his struggles with English make both working and expressing himself difficult.\\n“They took us in and I can’t ever repay them.\"\\nWhen Thuy, Michael and other sponsors come to visit, he feels helpless. “I can’t say more than ‘welcome’. Sometimes, I just want to sit and chat with them. I want to tell them about my life and what is in my heart, but I can’t.”\\nFor Thuy, her aim is to give the family what she never fully had – a safety net. She remembers only too well how the anxiety of a new culture and language overwhelmed her when she first came to Canada.\\n“The sponsors and I have promised to stay in touch with each other for the rest of our lives,” says Mohamed. “They took us in and I can’t ever repay them. But if ever one of them gets sick or needs me, I want them to call. I will help.”\\nNone'"

Now, off the coast of Italy\\'s Lampedusa island, the journey turned into a nightmare – the second of two shipwrecks last October in which hundreds of people drowned within sight of the shore. Back in Syria, before the violence and bloodshed, the brothers lived in a small, tight-knit community they describe as \"serene.\" Life was simple, and the streets were safe and clean. Then war broke out, uprooting innocent civilians from their homes. The one-way voyage had cost them US$ 2,000 each. Nobody guaranteed they would make it to Europe alive. Thamer and Thayer were among the millions who fled. \"There are a lot of people who decided not to kill or get killed, so they decided to leave,\" recalls Thamer, 27. Their first port of call was Libya, where they hoped to start a new life. With one brother studying engineering and the other training to become a chef, things began to look up. But as rule of law in the country deteriorated, their world fell apart once more. \"Libya became the centre for militia,\" says Thamer. \"Anyone could stop you, ask for your passport, and take you to prison because you were Syrian.\" Out of options, the brothers made a desperate decision. They were risking everything – not least their lives – but miles from home with an increasingly bleak future, there was almost nothing left to lose. Haunted by a Sinking Ship: Brothers Thamer and Thayer are haunted by the deadly shipwreck they survived off the coast of Lampedusa, Italy. Night was drawing in as they arrived clandestinely at the shore. Along with hundreds of other desperate asylum-seekers, they boarded a boat and set out for the southern coast of Italy, praying for a safe passage. They knew that capsizing was a very real possibility. But they never expected bullets. From somewhere nearby, militiamen opened fire on the boat, purportedly due to a disagreement between warring clans in Libya about payment. Thamer and Thayer clung to one another in the chaos. The water began to lap at their ankles. \"I saw my life flash before my eyes,\" recalls Thayer, 25. \"I saw my childhood. I saw people from when I was young. Things I thought I no longer remembered.\" \"I saw my childhood,\" Thayer recalls. \"I saw people from when I was young. Things I thought I no longer remembered.\" Over the next ten hours, water filled the boat until finally it capsized. Those close to the motor were killed instantly; others were thrown into the freezing waves. Although media reports estimate that the vessel contained a little over 200 people, Thamer and Thayer claim there were many more – at least 450, of whom more than half drowned. The brothers saw many of their fellow passengers perish. \"There was a pregnant woman with a son,\" Thayer murmurs. \"They passed away. The corpse of her son was floating on the water.\" He closes his eyes at the memory. Rescue, when it finally came, was too late for many. Thamer and Thayer were two of the lucky ones. Thamer (left) hopes to become an engineer. Thayer wants to be a chef. After surviving a deadly voyage across the Mediterranean Sea, the two brothers are seeking asylum in Sicily.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Alfredo D\\'Amato The October 3 and October 11 shipwrecks off the coast of Lampedusa sparked a broad debate on asylum policy in Europe, leading Italian authorities to launch a search and rescue operation known as Mare Nostrum. To date, it has rescued more than 80,000 people – undoubtedly saving the lives of many. Eight months on, Thamer and Thayer have applied for asylum in a sleepy coastal town in western Sicily. \"We want to make our own lives and move on,\" says Thayer. He and his brother are praying for one more chance.'],\n",

       "  '\"This is not the only thing he has done lately without my permission,\" says Fewaz, 44, lifting two fingers to his mouth and pretending to smoke. Like fathers and teenage sons everywhere, the pair sometimes struggle to coexist. Yet a powerful bond holds them together: Fewaz and Malak are refugees from Syria, stranded for almost a year in an impoverished neighbourhood of Athens. Life in exile has been harrowing for each of them. After fleeing Syria with the rest of their family in the summer of 2012, they turned to smugglers and made six perilous attempts to enter Greece, repeatedly risking their lives at sea and being turned back to Turkey. Fewaz and Malak finally reached safety, but along the way they were separated from the rest of their loved ones. A Teenager in Exile: Malak\\'s father, Fewaz, has tried to do what\\'s best for his family while escaping a war. Now he struggles to make the family whole again. Fewaz\\'s family belong to the Kurdish-speaking Yazidi minority in Syria. Back home, he farmed his land, Malak and his siblings attended school, and the family lived in peace. But after the conflict broke out, incursions and street battles eventually made their lives \"a living hell,\" Fewaz says. Driven from their own country, they fled to Turkey in July 2012 with hopes of making it to Europe. \"My life in Syria was so nice,\" young Malak recalls with a forlorn smile. \"I had school and friends and we would play. The atmosphere was great. We would go on trips to see relatives. But once the fighting started everything became frightening.\" Malak was the first to make it through the Evros border crossing into Greece. Fewaz, his wife and their two other children were not so lucky. That night they gathered on the Turkish coast, where a smuggler had made the arrangements to carry them to Greece. Fifty-four people boarded a six-metre-long boat – six times its official capacity. Each of them paid around €2,000 for their journey into the unknown. One passenger was given a quick lesson in how to manoeuvre the dilapidated boat. Then, with instructions to puncture the sides as soon as they saw the Greek coastguard, they set sail. Upon reflection, Fewaz expresses second thoughts about the monumental risk his family took. \"I did not realise that I was taking them from one death to another,\" he says. \"I could have been responsible for killing the very loved ones who are closest to me.\" The family\\'s third attempt, by sea, brought them perilously close to death. \"I did not realise that I was taking them from one death to another. I could have been responsible for killing the very loved ones who are closest to me.\" After an hour and a half at sea, Fewaz says, a Greek ship intercepted their boat. But instead of offering help, it turned them away. Fewaz remembers a coastguard officer barking orders at them \"to immediately return\" – and how their small, overcrowded boat rocked violently in the ship\\'s wake. Close to capsizing, they were forced to return to Turkey. But Fewaz pressed on, selling everything he owned and trying again to reach Greece. Finally, on the sixth attempt, his family crossed over at Evros. While his wife and two children travelled on to Germany, Fewaz headed to Athens to join Malak. \"When I finally saw my dad in Athens, I was so happy that words can\\'t describe,\" says Malak. However, the teenager is haunted by the possibility of losing his father again. \"I am afraid that if my dad is taken, what will I do without him?\" Fewaz\\'s story is one of desperation and extraordinary resilience, the story of a loving father trying to do what is best for his family while escaping a war. None of them knew it would lead to a lengthy separation. Until the family can be reunited, Malak and his father are determined to stick together. The boy is learning to get by in Greek. And Fewaz is starting to get used to his son\\'s haircut.'],\n",

       "  '\"You will feel the impact when they arrive,\" the captain told me, wiping beads of sweat from his forehead as he steered our Italian military ship through the waves. \"It is not something you can ever be fully prepared for. Every time is different.\" Down below, a rescue team was assembling. After several days of bad weather, it would be their first exercise that week – but not the last. Indeed, before retiring for the night, the crew would pick up more than 1,000 distressed passengers from four different boats. Women, children and those in need of medical attention were first off the rickety boat – among them, young mothers. \"Can my child have some milk?\" asked one, gaunt and exhausted, clutching a toddler with her arms. \"His feeding bottle fell into the water.\" As a total of 210 people boarded, I took the lady gently by the arm and asked where she was from. Her eyes were bloodshot from the tears. \"I am from the town where the revolution started,\" she replied, referring to Dara\\'a in Syria. \"Now my city is gone.\" Rescue at Sea: An Italian helicopter pilot scouts the Mediterranean Sea for boats carrying refugees and migrants in distress. The San Giorgio rescued over a thousand people that day. In a makeshift registration area, officers processed those who had fled their homes. \"I don\\'t think I have come across people from the Central African Republic and Kashmir at the same time,\" remarked one marine, jotting down names and nationalities. I peered over his shoulder. Sudan. Eritrea. Pakistan. Somalia. One weary man from Kashmir in Pakistan told us his name was Khan. At the age of 54, he had been forced into exile after military assaults created a living hell for him at home. A smuggler in Lahore promised him \"a better life in the West\" – the journey had cost him his life savings. Behind Khan was 25-year-old Mamadou, who had been displaced within Mali after an uprising and coup in 2012. The marine gave up after three attempts at spelling his name. \"Please write it yourself,\" he said, handing him the pen. Mamadou, when I found him later in the men\\'s section, explained to me how he had fled from Mali and eventually found his way to Libya. \"I knew it is very dangerous in Libya, but I had heard about boats that take you to Italy,\" he said, fatigue lining his face. \"I had to take the chance as I had been fleeing for over a year.\" They all had reasons for risking their lives at sea. Some had fled armed conflicts back home, others escaped political and religious persecution. Some had been at risk of modern-day slavery, others were manipulated by criminal gangs. Early the next morning I met Afwerki, who had paid €900 for his voyage at sea. The price set by the smugglers was just enough to deplete his savings, but not enough to earn him a life vest. Now 25, Afwerki had fled Eritrea several years earlier to avoid military service, but as a refugee in Ethiopia did not feel he could \"live freely and safely,\" he told me, chewing gratefully on a roll. \"I am from the wrong side of the border.\" He remains hopeful that in Europe his life will truly begin. In the first half of this year, Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt took in another 500,000 Syrian refugees â€“ bringing the regional total to nearly 3 million.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Younghee Lee At the other end of the spectrum is Anwar, 76, who held out as long as he could before fleeing his ancestral home in Syria. \"I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do,\" he told me, glancing at his young grandson. \"After 75 years in my country we were forced to run away, me and my sons. How is that possible?\" Thurayya, from Lattakia, had also been uprooted from her home, fleeing with two sons, a husband and six other family members. Back in Syria, she had been an English teacher at an elementary school. That day, I found her sitting in a large section crammed with families. \"When do you think we will reach Italy?\" she asked me, in perfect English. Others wanted to know the same – desperately seeking refuge, having travelled hundreds of miles and risked death at sea. Counting on Europe. I hoped it wouldn\\'t let them down. Later, as we approached the harbour, a weight seemed to lift. There, at last, was land. For the hungry and exhausted, life was about to begin again.'],\n",

Carrying a heavy heart, he travelled for two days before reaching Turkey. There, Ali and his two older children boarded a small rubber dinghy and set out for Samos Island.

       "  \"The day we left, we cried and cried but we couldn’t stay in Afghanistan any more. At the time I thought we would return one day. I didn’t expect my life would take this turn. We lived in Iran for three years, paperless, penniless and experiencing intense racism. My brother then decided to send me to a European country where he believed things would be ‘better’. I crossed the sea to Lesvos Island, Greece, and then travelled to Athens. During that journey, I lost my most valuable possession: my father’s ring which was the only thing I had to remind me of him. How many years can a person live without a future? I am now 23 and have been living in Greece for seven years. My life gets worse day by day. How many years can a person live without a future? I applied for asylum in 2008 and never received any response. I have no papers, no home, no job. I have tried to leave but without success. I don’t expect anything anymore. The problems have made me lose my mind. As if all this wasn't enough, in late May this year, I got beaten up on the street. I had just arrived in Athens from Igoumenitsa port after another failed attempt to reach Italy. It was 3.30 a.m. and was heading to a friend’s house. Five men suddenly surrounded me and started hitting me on the face. I got dizzy and fell down but they kept kicking me. When they saw I was not moving, they took off. My nose was broken and my eye was swollen. At the hospital they said I was lucky they didn’t draw a knife. I can’t stay here anymore. I want to go somewhere where there are laws. If they killed me that night, nobody would do a thing. What despairs me the most is that I cannot help my mother. I hear she is sick and very worried for me. My brother is still in Iran unable to help. If my life weren’t in danger in Afghanistan, I would go back in a minute. \\xa0 *Name changed for protection reasons.

       "  'At sea, the cries of her fellow passengers, the turbulent waves and the tightening clasp of her sons\\' hands told her all she needed to know. They had hoped to find land in eight hours. After nearly two nights, 34-year-old Jihan feared the worst. \"In those moments,\" she remembers, sadly, \"I felt that I had taken my kids from one looming possibility of death to another.\" Hungry, thirsty and afraid for their lives, the family finally reached the shores of Europe after a perilous 45 hours at sea. But they were far from their chartered route – stranded on the Greek island of Milos. Without support or assistance, they had to find their own way to Athens. \"We had our kids with us and no food or water,\" says Jihan, whose husband Ashraf is also partially blind. \"So we had no choice but to travel through the mountains.\" In Athens, the police detained them for four days. \"They told us we could not stay in Athens or three other Greek cities,\" she recalls, wiping away a tear from the corner of her eye. By now exhausted and destitute, Ashraf set out ahead in search of asylum further north, while Jihan and the children headed to Lavrion camp, an informal settlement about 40 kilometres outside the Greek capital. It was the first time that Ashraf and Jihan had been separated since they were 12. \"Given that we both do not see well, we truly do complete each other,\" Jihan explains, with a melancholy smile. \"For example, when we have to buy an appliance, he chooses the colour because he can see a bit more than me, and I choose the model.\" Now, nine months on, while Ashraf waits for his family to join him in Denmark, Jihan must increasingly rely on her seven-year-old son, Mohammad, to navigate their temporary home. Without an urgent cornea transplant, her left eye may close forever. Her neighbours in the camp, mostly families with young children, are also suffering. \"I thought given my special situation, the government would give us additional help,\" Jihan says, hopelessly. \"But they help no one at all. There is a family with six children and a woman who has cancer here, but no one aids them. We are trapped.\" Once, Jihan led a happy life in Aleppo, working in the public sector, with two sons and a loving husband by her side. Now, her only wish is for her family to be reunited. Although war drove them from their homeland, Europe has torn them apart. \"We came here for a better life and to find people who might better understand our situation,\" she concludes. \"I am so upset when I see how little they do [understand].\"'],\n",

       "  'Upon arrival, Habiba was so weakened and dehydrated by her three-month ordeal that she was unable to breastfeed her two-month-old daughter, Ramatou. The tiny, malnourished infant was born deep in the forest, a month after the family had been forced to flee their home in Bouguere, in the strife-torn Central African Republic. \"The children were always hungry,\" a famished and exhausted Habiba said a day after arriving in Chad. \"We would walk for kilometres in search of water. I gave birth to my daughter in the bush, in the middle of the forest. But I had nothing to eat, so I have no more milk.\" Hunger, and hard choices, for Africa\\'s struggling refugees: Ration cuts are affecting nearly 800,000 refugees in nine African nations as the World Food Programme wrestles with a $186 million funding shortfall.  At Dosseye and at least 50 other sites in nine African countries, a serious funding shortfall – compounded by security and logistical problems in some areas – is forcing cuts of up to 60 per cent in the daily food rations provided by WFP for nearly 800,000 refugees. As of mid-June, one third of all African refugees dependent on food assistance had been affected by ration cuts, the majority of them by more than 50 per cent. \"It is unacceptable in today\\'s world of plenty for refugees to face chronic hunger or that their children drop out of school to help families survive,\" said UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres. Ertharin Cousin, WFP\\'s Executive Director, added: \"Many refugees in Africa depend on WFP food to stay alive and are now suffering because of a shortage of funding. So we are appealing to donor governments to help all refugees – half of whom are children – have enough food to be healthy and to build their own futures.\" \"It is unacceptable in today\\'s world of plenty for refugees to face chronic hunger – or that their children drop out of school to help families survive,\" said UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres. WFP needs to raise US$ 186 million to maintain feeding programmes for refugees in Africa through the end of the year. Additionally, UNHCR is seeking contributions towards the anticipated US$ 39 million cost of providing nutrition support for malnourished and vulnerable refugees in Africa for the rest of 2014. The ration cuts are taking the heaviest toll in Chad, Central African Republic and South Sudan, all with reductions of 50-60 per cent that affect a total of 449,516 refugees. Another 65,354 refugees have been hit by ration cuts of 25-49 per cent in Liberia and Burkina Faso. Nearly 9,900 refugees in Mozambique and Ghana have seen their rations reduced by 10-24 per cent, while another 263,000 refugees in Mauritania and Uganda have experienced cuts of less than 10 per cent. The food ration cuts are most severe in Chad, Central African Republic and South Sudan.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/WFP Although several African nations face chronic food shortages, refugees are a particularly vulnerable group and any disruption in supplies is a major cause for concern. Like Habiba and her family, many refugees arrive malnourished and suffering from various nutrition-related disorders. Many require urgent supplementary feeding and other long-term care, particularly undernourished children. Now, however, a lack of funding has forced WFP to take difficult and drastic action and confronted refugee families with some very hard choices. Some 300,000 refugees in Chad, primarily from Sudan\\'s Darfur region in the east and from Central African Republic in the south, are among the worst affected. Their previous ration of 2,100 kilocalories has been slashed by 60 per cent, leaving refugees with a scant 850 kilocalories per day. The situation worsens by the day as hundreds of thousands of hungry refugees struggle to cope. Unable to go home, many refugees remain in exile for years and even decades in what UNHCR calls \\'protracted refugee situations.\\' Across Africa, hundreds of thousands of long-term refugees are in remote camps and other sites, where they are often totally dependent on international help and a sometimes precarious food pipeline. The camps in eastern Chad are a case in point. Although Darfur has largely disappeared from public consciousness in recent years, some 241,000 refugees from that region of Sudan are still living in a string of 13 isolated camps stretching along hundreds of kilometres of desolate border in eastern Chad. Habiba, 24, feeds porridge to young Ramatou, who was born deep in the forest as the fled Central African Republic. Both mother and child are struggling to survive.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Corentin Fohlen Ensuring that all African refugees in far-flung camps – both new arrivals like Habiba and her family as well as those in protracted situations – get enough to eat is a mammoth task requiring hundreds of millions of dollars, incredibly complex logistics and sustained international support. Right now, that support is falling short and refugees are suffering as a result. Insecurity has limited access to some sites, making it harder and costlier to deliver food rations to hungry refugees. In South Sudan, for example, conflict has cut off road and river access to some camps, forcing WFP to orchestrate costly airlifts and further depleting available funds. Immediate action is needed to ensure both humanitarian access and sustained funding. A sustained, 60 per cent cut in refugee food rations can be catastrophic. But even a small reduction can spell disaster for vulnerable refugees already living on the edge of starvation. Hajara, 19, and her children await their first hot meal in over two months. They arrived in Dosseye refugee camp the previous day after fleeing violence in Central African Republic.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Corentin Fohlen Undernutrition during a child\\'s first 1,000 days from conception can have irreversible, lifelong repercussions, compromising both physical growth and mental development. Studies have shown that this \"stunting\" leaves affected children at a severe social and economic disadvantage for the rest of their lives. According to UNICEF, a stunted child is often inches shorter than a child who\\'s had enough of the right kind of food. With weaker immune systems, they are more vulnerable to disease. And they\\'re five times more likely to die from diarrhoea. The risk to the child is even greater if the mother, like Habiba, is herself malnourished during pregnancy and then unable to breastfeed. That\\'s why UNHCR hastens to identify the most vulnerable refugees and ensure that they get extra nutritional help through supplemental feeding programmes for mothers and children. But the recent 60 per cent cuts in Chad mean that refugees can\\'t get all the help they need. At Dosseye, for example, the health centre has run out of supplemental food stocks for pregnant and nursing mothers – items like extra flour, sugar and oil that could help Habiba regain her strength and her ability to breastfeed her baby. Now, frail Ramatou will have to struggle to survive without her mother\\'s nourishing milk. Undernutrition during a child\\'s first 1,000 days from conception can have irreversible, lifelong repercussions – compromising physical growth and mental development. Even prior to the recent cuts, nutritional surveys in several African refugee camps between 2011 and 2013 showed that acute malnutrition, stunting and anaemia among children were at critical levels. Only one of 92 camps surveyed, for example, met UNHCR\\'s goal of fewer than 20 per cent of refugee children suffering from anaemia. And fewer than 15 per cent of camps surveyed met the target of less than 20 per cent stunting among children. Surveys also showed that global acute malnutrition rates among refugee children 6-59 months old remain unacceptably high in over 60 per cent of camps surveyed. This means these sites failed to meet UNHCR\\'s target of a global acute malnutrition rate of less than 10 per cent. A Sudanese mother and son seek treatment in Chad\\'s Iridimi refugee camp. The malnutrition rate in the camp is 13.7 per cent for children under age five.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Corentin Fohlen Given the extreme vulnerability of refugees, UNHCR and WFP have made a concerted effort over the past five years to improve nutritional standards in refugee camps. This includes measures to prevent and treat micronutrient deficiencies that cause stunting, anaemia and other ailments. The micronutrient program has helped to slow and even reverse rising rates of these nutrition-related problems in some areas. But UNHCR says real success in combating widespread undernutrition among refugees will require sustained support and attention. And now the hard-won gains of the past five years could be lost due to the current shortfalls in funding and food. Having fled their homelands with little more than the clothes on their backs, most refugees have few if any additional resources to make up for any reduction in food for their families. Their options are severely limited, particularly in camps where they have little or no access to work, agricultural or grazing land, or other means of self-sufficiency. Some of them resort to so-called \\'negative coping strategies,\\' triggering a range of additional problems. These include an increase in school dropouts as refugee children seek work to help buy food for their families; exploitation and abuse of women refugees who venture out of camps in search of work or land to grow crops; \"survival sex\" by women and girls trying to raise money to buy food; early marriage of young girls; increased stress and domestic violence within families; and more incidents of theft and other activities that raise tensions within camps and with surrounding communities. \"We are facing many difficulties since the food rations were cut in January,\" said Khatr Maghiba Adam, head of the women\\'s refugee committee in Iridimi camp in eastern Chad. \"We don\\'t know what to do… Some women are not able to breastfeed; they have no more milk. Women leave the camp to work in Iriba and leave their children behind. We are calling for help.\" \"All my brothers go to school,\" said Fatima. \"But I saw my mother suffering and I left school to help her. I am the oldest child.\" \"If the situation continues,\" says Abdel, a teacher in Iridimi camp, \"soon there will be no children left in the schools.\" Hadja, whose father left six years ago and whose mother is sick and unable to provide for the family, dropped out of 6th grade. Teachers in the camp say class sizes have dwindled since the rations were cut earlier this year. \"Today, only 26 children out of 59 attend class,\" said Abdel Alim Fadoul, a teacher in Iridimi. \"The others are working at the weekly market in Iriba. If the situation continues like that, soon there will be no children left in the schools.\" Hadja and Fatima have joined about 50 other women and girls from various camps who now sleep rough each night under a tree in Iriba. Each day they roam the dusty town looking for work; in the evenings, they pool their meagre resources to buy food for a communal meal. They make bricks, build walls, carry water and gravel, do domestic work, cut firewood and perform other chores – all for a few Sudanese pounds a day. Sometimes, townspeople take advantage of them. \"Some of the women we work for are mean; they send us away after we worked without paying us,\" said Fatima, who had just spent two days doing household chores without being paid. Some of the girls who stay under the tree have resorted to prostitution to help feed their families. \"There are girls who stay with us but disappear at night,\" Fatima said. \"They receive phone calls and they leave… One even gave birth. We all know the situation, but we don\\'t do that. We stay with the women here [under the tree].\" A young refugee from CAR is tested for malaria at the health centre in Dosseye camp. The food shortage affects malaria patients, who need an adequate diet for a full recovery.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Corentin Fohlen Chronically hungry refugees face a vicious cycle of poverty, food insecurity, poor nutrition, heightened risk of disease and risky coping strategies. Improving nutrition and food security is crucial. That\\'s why UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF and their NGO partners are embracing the most up-to-date approaches to nutrition and food security for the forcibly displaced and striving to improve services in related areas like reproductive health, malaria and child survival. But all of this work requires sustained international support. \"The number of crises around the world is far outpacing the level of funding for humanitarian operations, and vulnerable refugees in critical operations are falling through the cracks,\" Guterres said. Food security for refugees isn\\'t solely a responsibility of donor governments. There is much that agencies on the ground, host governments, local authorities and the refugees themselves can do to stabilize the situation. For example, UNHCR and WFP are encouraging African governments to provide refugees with agricultural plots and grazing land to increase self-sufficiency. Facing ration cuts, Sudanese refugee women try to grow vegetables in Iridimi camp. But eastern Chad is extremely arid, and access to water is difficult, so agriculture is not a viable option for most refugees.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Corentin Fohlen Refugees who fled from Central African Republic to southern Chad between 2004 and 2006 were granted plots of up to two hectares when they first arrived. This access to farmland has helped them feed their families, generate income to pay for their children\\'s education and offset the current ration cuts. A recent UNHCR survey of refugee sites in 30 African countries found moderate to high use of land by refugees for agriculture in 42 per cent of the sites. The same percentage reported that refugees currently have access to adequate grazing land in or around camps. Where viable, expanding such access could significantly boost self-sufficiency among refugees in other locations. But with arable land scarce in many parts of Africa, UNHCR and WFP are also urging host governments and local authorities to grant refugees working rights and more access to local markets. These measures would benefit not only refugees, but local communities as well. The agencies are also determined to promote refugee self-sufficiency as early as possible in future emergencies, thus reducing long-term dependency. With arable land scarce in many parts of Africa, UNHCR and WFP are also urging host governments and local authorities to grant refugees working rights and more access to local markets. Other actions to promote food security include scaling up the provision of cash and vouchers for food assistance as a way to strengthen local markets. In protracted situations, the agencies will work with local authorities to promote refugee participation in small-scale enterprises to increase self-reliance. Given the unpredictability of funding, the agencies are also refining their methods of prioritising those hit hardest by ration cuts to ensure that the most vulnerable are identified and receive the help they need. All of these measures can help alleviate the impact of funding and food shortages over the long term. But that may be too late for tens of thousands of suffering refugees like Habiba, Ramatou, Fatima and Hadja. They need help now.'],\n",

       "  'I\\'ve come here to see how they are getting by. The women and girls take any job they can get – cleaning houses, doing laundry, fetching water and firewood, doing construction work. Each night, they gather again beneath the tree, pool their meagre resources for a communal meal and go to sleep on the hard ground. And each morning, they set out once again to search the dusty streets of Iriba for work. Some of the 50 Sudanese women who sleep under a tree after looking for work in Iriba to make up for ration cuts.\\xa0 ©\\xa0UNHCR/Corentin Fohlen \"We are really in need of money, that\\'s why we came here to work,\" says a 16-year-old girl I\\'ll call Fatima. \"We walk through the town, people call us for work. We prepare clay for walls, we make bricks and we build walls. Sometimes, we are asked to destroy sheds and build new ones. We go to the bush to fetch gravel to make backyards look nice. We also cut wood. We pound okra and dried tomatoes. We wash clothes, and we… go to the market to buy things. We also fetch water.\" For domestic work, Fatima earns between two and ten Sudanese pounds a day – less than US$ 1.75. Construction work pays better: up to 20 Sudanese pounds, or US$ 3.50, per day. But even when they do find work, the women and girls often find themselves being exploited or cheated by their employers. \"Some of the women we work for are mean,\" says Fatima. \"They send us away after we worked without paying us.\" For two days in a row, she has worked as a servant for a local family but has not been paid. Now she had no money to contribute to the night\\'s communal meal beneath the tree, and will have to depend on the generosity of the other refugee women for her dinner. In recent months, the 300,000 refugees in Chad who are dependent on WFP food have seen their daily rations reduced from 2,100 kilocalories per person per day to around 850 kilocalories. Over 240,000 of them are refugees who fled the Darfur region of Sudan and are now living in 13 remote camps stretched along hundreds of kilometres of desolate border in eastern Chad. Unlike the other 60,000, who escaped fighting in Central African Republic and are staying in camps in Chad\\'s more fertile south, the Sudanese refugees living in the dry, desert camps of the east are largely unable to grow their own crops to make up some of the food shortfall. For the most part, they remain entirely dependent on the flow of humanitarian assistance, now slowed to a trickle. The refugee women from Iridimi, Touloum and Am Nabak refugee camps near Iriba worry about the consequences of the current food shortage. They say the monthly food rations being distributed in the camps don\\'t even last a week. They are struggling to feed their families and pay school fees for their children. \"Some women are not able to breastfeed; they have no more milk. We are calling for help.\" \"We don\\'t know what to do,\" says Khatr Maghiba Adam, president of the women\\'s refugee committee in Iridimi camp. \"Some women find their way, but others, such as those with children whose husbands are not here, suffer. Some women are not able to breastfeed; they have no more milk. Women leave the camp to work in Iriba and leave their children behind. We are calling for help. We are asking whether we could be transferred to another area where we could do agriculture.\" UNHCR and WFP have been warning the international community for months about the dramatic impact of the food shortages on refugees, most of whom were living hand-to-mouth even before the cuts. Another consequence is absenteeism in refugee camp schools as children leave to go in search of work in nearby towns. Many end up carrying goods for local traders on market days. \"Today, only 26 children out of a 59 attended class,\" says Abdel Alim Fadoul, a teacher in Iridimi\\'s primary school. \"The others are working at the weekly market in Iriba. If the situation continues like that, soon there will be no children in the schools.\" Agriculture is only a limited option for the refugees in the arid east of Chad. The soil is dry, rain is scarce and access to water is a challenge. To augment their diet, and compensate for a lack of grain, some refugees have resorted to harvesting toxic wild berries, which must be soaked for a week and then pounded into porridge. The last time people ate these wild berries in eastern Chad was during the famine in the 1980s. Desperate to feed their families, some women are resorting to prostitution. \"There are girls who stay with us but disappear at night,\" Fatima says. \"They receive phone calls and they leave. They leave to meet with men and they receive money. They make much more money than us. There are other girls who see these girls and follow them and agree to do the same. They leave when it is dark and come back before the morning prayer. One even gave birth.\" \"We are trapped by the climate and the environment. Otherwise, like other refugees, we would have developed solutions to take care of ourselves.\" Refugees are also looking at other possibilities for earning money, like baking bread or making soap. But the options are limited. \"We have been here a long time, but we have been unable to be self-sufficient,\" says Zacharia Ismael Nahar, a Sudanese refugee in Touloum camp. \"It\\'s a big problem we have in our hearts, but we are trapped by the climate and the environment. Otherwise, like other refugees, we would have developed solutions to take care of ourselves. But here, because of the climate and the environment we are dependent on humanitarian assistance.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"I gave birth to my daughter in the bush, in the middle of the forest,\" says Habiba, herself exhausted and emaciated after a dangerous, three-month trek to reach safety in Chad. \"I had nothing to eat and so I had no more milk.\" Habiba tells me that, together with her husband and their children, she fled Bouguere, Central African Republic (CAR), when armed men attacked their village, killing indiscriminately. For three long months, the family walked through the bush trying to avoid danger, sleeping rough and searching constantly for scarce food and water. Ramatou was born one month into the journey. \"On the way, hunger made us weak,\" Habiba recalls. \"The children were always hungry. We walked through regions where there was nothing to eat, no water. We were walking for kilometres to find water.\" Late one afternoon in May, the family finally crossed the border into Chad, joining thousands of other refugees from CAR who arrive each month. Since January, some 14,000 refugees have arrived in southern Chad, bringing the total from CAR now living there to 90,000. Weak with hunger and thirst, but relieved to have finally found help, Habiba and family were transferred from the border by UNHCR staff to the Dosseye refugee camp. Although they have now found safety, their problems are not over. I\\'ve come here to learn more about how they are coping. Without enough to eat, newly arriving refugees are struggling to survive. Like Habiba and her family, many walked for up to four months to reach Chad. They arrive exhausted, sick and malnourished. Since January, a lack of funding has forced the World Food Programme to cut refugee food rations in camps in Chad by 60 per cent – part of wider reductions that now affect nearly 800,000 refugees in nine African countries. \"I arrived yesterday at 3 p.m. and I have not yet seen a doctor,\" Habiba says. \"Later I will have to go to the hospital with my child to check her situation.\" But when Habiba goes to the health centre at the camp, she will not receive all the help she needs. Since the funding shortfall emerged, stocks of supplemental food for pregnant and lactating women have run short at the centre. This extra food typically includes staples such as flour, sugar and oil and was aims to ensure that mothers and babies receive proper nutrition during the critical periods before and after giving birth. Now, with the cut in basic food rations as well as the reduction in supplements, Habiba and her baby will struggle to survive. \"Before, WFP used to give specific food to all breastfeeding mothers for six months and to all pregnant women as of their second semester of pregnancy,\" says Joseph Mounkang, a nurse at the Dosseye health centre. \"The food supplements consisted of 200 grams of flour, 125 grams of sugar and 25 grams of oil for every woman every day. This year, WFP does not have the means to continue and therefore they had to cut the food supplements. Now when women arrive at the health centre, we have nothing to give them.\" Houriatou Issa, 32, and her son, Amadou, 13, both suffer from severe malnutrition and went to the health centre for help. Lacking any supplemental food stocks, the centre gave both mother and son packets of Plumpy\\'Nut, a peanut-based paste containing sugar, vegetable fat and skimmed milk powder enriched with vitamins and minerals. Normally, the centre only gives the paste to children under five, said Mounkang. Adults require additional supplements. \"I fled with my son,\" Houriatou tells me. \"We were in the middle of the bush and we both fell sick. Now my child eats a little bit of rice and Plumpy\\'Nut. I don\\'t have any appetite, but when I started to eat Plumpy\\'Nut, I gained a little energy again.\" \"If patients don\\'t eat well, they are subject to infections,\" the doctor tells me. \"And they cannot take medication without eating.\" Staff at the health centre say they don\\'t like giving the nut paste to adults, but it\\'s all they\\'ve got. \"This is the only solution we found to help them survive,\" says Mounkang. \"We will ask WFP if they can\\'t find a small quantity of food supplements to help these women.\" The food shortage is also putting refugees with HIV/AIDS, malaria and other ailments at greater risk. Without proper nutrition, their treatment and recovery are jeopardised. \"If patients don\\'t eat well, they are subject to infections,\" says Dr. Mbakaou Ndeingar. \"And they cannot take medication without eating. Medication should be taken after meals to facilitate absorption.\"']]"
